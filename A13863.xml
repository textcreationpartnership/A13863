            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE FIRST READING.</head>
            <p>I HAVE choſen this parte of the holie ſcripture, wherein to trauail with you at this time bicauſe thorough goddes great wrath againſt ſinne, and the moſt deſpiteful malice of Satan againſt the truth, the olde hainous hereſie of the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>godlie Arrians, is renued in our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tree, and as it were raiſed vp againe from hel. Theſe cankerd old Arrians, that you maie undreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de their hereſie, ſpake blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemouſly of the godhead of our Lorde Ieſus. For the firſt autor of it Arrius vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered erroniouſly, &amp; vngodly in the ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of Alexandria, in Aegypte, that there was a time, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goddes ſonne was not. By which wordes he ment, that he was not of the ſame beinge, and ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that the father is of, nor of the fame aeternitie and ſo not the natural ſonne of God, and verie God in dede, but an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of God, whereby God made al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:5"/> as by a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as he him ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in farther declaration of his mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.</p>
            <p>For he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that the Lorde Ieſus was the firſt, and cheifeſt creature, &amp; the beginninge of al other creatures, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him alſo the name of God. Howbeit he thought not that he had his Godhed by nature, but by borowinge.</p>
            <p>For trial of this matter the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and godlie Emperor Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine the great, called a general concile at Nice, of thre hundred, and eightene biſhoppes, of whom manie for ſingular lerninge and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, manie for great holines of life, were compted worthie of euerlaſtinge reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. In this famous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded out of the holie ſcriptures, that goddes ſonne is of the ſame aeternitee, of the ſame ſubſtance, eſſence, &amp; beinge, that God the father is, goddes natural ſonne, and coaequal with the father, as it appeareth in the Crede, communely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Nicene Crede. Whereunto the hole aſſemble agreed, and ſubſcribed, ſauinge theſe fiue, Euſebius biſhoppe of Nicomedia, Theognis biſhoppe of Ni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce, Maris biſhoppe of Calchedon, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognis
<pb facs="tcp:26560:5"/> biſhoppe of Marmarike, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus biſhoppe of Ptolemais. Which fiue biſhoppes for their vngodlines, by the emperors commaundement, were baniſhed out of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trees. But ſone after their exile, Euſebius, and Theog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis repented that thei had don ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly, and ſent a boke of repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to the godlie biſhoppes, wherin they vſed theſe wordes. We haue agreed to the faith, and after we had made inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the meaninge of this worde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſubſtantial, we were throughly quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And in dede we claue not to the hae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſie, yea we ſubſcribed to the faith, but we ſubſcribed not to the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Not that we reproue the faith, but we beleued not that he, that is to ſaie, Arrius, was ſuch one, as he was accuſed to be. But if the holie councile be ſo perſuaded, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne not, but conſente to your decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and confirme our conſente with this our preſent writinge, not that we can not beare our baniſhment, but to auoide the ſuſpition of haereſie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:6"/>
            <p>Out of theſe wordes Socrates the ſtorie writer geſſeth, that theſe two ſubſcribed to the faith agreed vpon in the concile of Nice, but wolde not alowe the depoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Arrius.</p>
            <p>This matter beinge thus wiſely and godly eſtably ſhed, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to be trobled againe, by this occaſion. Conſtatine the emperor had a ſiſter called Conſtantia, in to whoſe fauor a certaine preiſt crep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſo far, that ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted him as one of hir awne. This preiſt, whoſe name the ſtorie writer vttereth not, as worthie perpetual obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by thaduiſe of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius declared to Conſtantia, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cile had don Arrius wronge, and that he thought not as the rumor went. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die durſt not tel the Emperor that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and yet ſhe beleued hir preiſt. It happened ſone after that ſhe fel ſicke, and the Emperor hir brother cam to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hir, at which time ſhe ſingularly com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended hir preiſt vnto him. Who imme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diately vpon hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation receaued him in to his fauor, and familiaritie. The preiſt hauinge gotten boldnes, and liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tee of talke, renued vnto him, Arrius his matter, affirminge that he agreed
<pb facs="tcp:26560:6"/> with the concile. The emperor au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if Arrius wold conſent to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cile, he wolde receaue him to fauor, and ſende him againe to Alexandria, to be reſtored to his former place. And there vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent Lettres to Arrius to repare ſpedely vnto him. Whan Arrius was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and preſented before the Emperor, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him, whether he conſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to the faith of the Nicene concile.</p>
            <p>Arrius aunſwered that he did conſente there vnto. The Emperor bad hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put his faith in writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, he did ſo, &amp; this was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; of Euzoius that was hta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there with hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We beleue in one god, the father almightie, and in the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne begotten of him befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re al worldes god the worde, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thinges were made, both thinges in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and thinges in erth. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror forthwith wrote to Athanaſius biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop off Alexandria to receaue Arrius, and to reſtore him to his roome. And bicauſe Athanaſius refuſed ſo to do, he was depoſed. Than beganne Arrius to ſow againe his enuenimed ſeedes.</p>
            <p>The Emperor enformed of his nawhg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie behauior, ſent for him againe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:26560:7"/> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople, and aſked him once mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, whether he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to the determi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation of the Nicene concile. He aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yea, with out anie ſtaggeringe the Emperor meruailinge at the matter, required of him, to confirme his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with an othe. And he toke his othe incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, vſinge therein fond craft, and ſubtiltie. For he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his awne doctrine in a paper, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſame vndre his arme hole, and ſo ſware that his ſentence was, as he had there written, meaninge the paper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre his arme hole. Here vpon rhe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror commended him to the biſhoppe of Conſtantinople, to be receaued to the communion of catholike Chriſtian me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alexander the biſhoppe knowinge the malitious wilines of Arrius, ſtaied at the matter. Euſebius a ſtoute man, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good biſhoppe, that if he wold not willingly admitte Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius to the communion, he ſhuld be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelled thereunto by force.</p>
            <p>The biſhoppe perceauinge that he was not able to reſiſte the violence of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius hauinge the Emperor alſo on his ſide, fel to praier, and continued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:26560:7"/> al night liynge proſtrate before the lordes table. In the morninge Euſebius accompanied with a bande of men, went to Arrius his lodginge, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to folow him to the temple.</p>
            <p>Euerie mannes minde was occupied with expectation of the ende, knowin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the fiercenes of Euſebius, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantie, and godlines of Alexander. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius by the waye as he was goinge to church in the middeſt of that route, for mannes neceſſitie deſired to goe a ſide to a priuie, where his guttes barſt out, and he died an horrible vile, ſtinckinge, and ſhameful death. And ſo the good biſhoppe was by miracle deliuered from great feare, and burthen of conſcience, and proud Euſebius diſapointed of his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Howbeit afterwarde by the meanes of that nawghtie preiſt, and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Conſtantine the Emperors ſonne, whoſe fauor the preiſt got by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him the teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peror left in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, the haereſie of vile Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was ſo reuiued, &amp; mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined, that it cold not be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched, but with great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail of lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; blode of manie Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyrs.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:8"/> For heretikes if thei once preuaile, ar moſt cruel perſequutors, as in old time the tru Chriſtians felt, in the furious rage of the haeretical Arrianes, and we now fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le vndre the moſt bloodie haeretical Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latres. Neuertheles the goodnes of God was ſuch, that for the confuſion, and <abbr>ov<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>throwi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge</abbr> of this moſt horrible haereſie, he raiſed vp moſt excellent wittes, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of moſt ſingular lerninge, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo that in proceſſe of time, after great trauail, after terrible tormentes, &amp; moſt cruel kindes of death, which the godlie ſuffred, this haereſie was vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, and beaten doune to hel.</p>
            <p>But now as good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reporte, ſondrie phrantike ſpirites labour to blow life in to it, and to cal it againe in to the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, out of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s darcke dongeon. And if al be tru that I haue hearde, thei haue pat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched two, or three peeces of their awne to that ilfauored bodie, and haue made it a fowler mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter than it was before.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer thei haue handled their monſtruous babie, it ſhalbe good for vs, to know the truth of this matter, and to haue readie a perfecte rule, to iudge all maner of doctrines. Whan we haue a
<pb facs="tcp:26560:8"/> true rule out of goddes worde, it ſhalbe eaſie to auoide al falſe inuentions. For what ſo agreeth not to that rule is to be refuſed, and caſt awaie. Therefore we ought firſt to labor to know what hte ſcripture teacheth, and to cleaue there to, whatſoeuer, ether lerned wittes can ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tilly deuiſe, or phrantike braines fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and rauingely dreame out, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re forth at auenture, in their trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. If we bringe al thinges to this touchſtone, we ſhal neuer be deceaued by anie new broched doctrine. But bicauſe the matter of al other is moſt high, &amp; moſt excedin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge our capacitee, we ought wit al h feare, reuerence, ſobrenes, and modeſtie to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proch vnto it, &amp; in no wiſe to entre in to a place, of ſuch maieſtie, brightnes, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie with foule fete, and to touch ſo holie thinges, with vncleane handes. Comme therefore my brethern with al humilite, and reuerent behauior to the goſpell of, S. Iohan. For it is euidently true that none of the diuine writers haue handled this our preſent matter, ſo largely, ſo plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, &amp; ſo ſtrongely againſt al cauillations. And therefore I haue purpoſely take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hande, to treate ſome parte of his moſt
<pb facs="tcp:26560:9"/> diuine worcke amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you that, we maye al certai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly know what we ought to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of the lorde Ieſus in this behalfe, and that we maie be ſurely armed agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the hiſſinges of the venimous ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes cloue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. For in dede it is a communs opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the olde eccleſiaſtical writers, that. S. Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrote this treatiſe purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt ſuch haeretikes, as in his time denied the diuinitie of Chriſt, namely Carpocrates, Cerinthus, and the Hebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, verie poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vndreſtanding according to their name, which taught that the Lord Ieſus was a man only, &amp; not God. Certainly the purpoſe, and cheife marke of the hole worcke is, to teach that Ieſus our Lorde was not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, but alſo God, and ſo the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſias, and verie Saueor of the worlde.</p>
            <p>The goſpel after, S. Iohan) Euangelio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſignifieth good tidinges. And in the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie writers it ſignifieth a publike, ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preachinge of Chriſt, who by his death hath purged our ſinnes, and beinge riſſen from the deed, raigneth in the hertes of his choſen, and renueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto godlines thorough his ſpirite mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiynge from time to time their fleſhlie
<pb facs="tcp:26560:9"/> luſtes, and aboliſhinge more and more the remnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of their natural corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this in dede is verie good tidin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges. For here by we ar deliuered from the feare of death and damnation, and from the bondage of ſinne, &amp; Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, brei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely hereby we ar remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> darcknes to light, from deſpeare, to good hope from death to life, from hel to heauen. Now bicauſe the office of proclaminge, and publiſhinge this moſt ioiful tidi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, was committed to the miniſters of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the name of Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes is moſt proprely attributed to them, &amp; ſpecially to thoſe that diſcribe the natiui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tee, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, death, &amp; reſurrection of the lorde Ieſus, wherein this bliſful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reſteth, that we ſo much aduance.</p>
            <p>Some writers affirme that as manie pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſes of felicitie, and ſaluation as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, ſo manie goſpels there be, and that therefore the prophetes ar alſo euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes, whan they ſpeake of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that goddes annointed ſhuld acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. I thincke it not good to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boute wordes, and I denie not that the hebrue word, Baſſar, which ſignifieth to euangelize, &amp; to preach good tidinges
<pb facs="tcp:26560:10"/> is applied in ſome place to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the old time. Howbeit I beleue rather, that Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelion is an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publiſhinge of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al readie perfirmed, &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed, than of the ſame promiſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſpeake more diſtinctly, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prely that giue the name of Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſtes to thapoſtles, &amp; writers of the hiſtorie of the lorde Ieſus, &amp; finally to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And to giue place rather to this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of our ſaueor in the 16. of Luke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue me, where he ſaieth that the law, and the prophetes were vnto Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſte, &amp; that from that time the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god was eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelized. The kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god was in dede taught before, and the goſpel preached in ſome wiſe, but it was not ſo ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, ſo largely, ſo plainly, ſo far &amp; wide publiſhed, and proclaimed.</p>
            <p>But herein as I ſaid I wil conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with no man, nor binde the worde to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only. For I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t what a wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glinge wit maie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the fourth cha. to the Hebr. After S. Iohan). The hiſtorie of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſheweth that the Lorde Ieſus out of
<pb facs="tcp:26560:10"/> the nombre of his diſciples choſe twel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue principal, whom he called Apoſtles, bicauſe they ſhuld be ſent as his ſpecial Embaſſadors in to al the world to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and preach the glad tidinges of free ſaluation. And amonge theſe twelue there were three yet more ſpecial, &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gular furniſhed with moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and therefore admitted to certaine thinges, where thother were excluded.</p>
            <p>Of theſe three Iohan was one, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſingularly and ſpecially, that he was the lordes biloued. To whom alſo the Lorde gaue this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous name, that he was called the ſon of thondre. And ſurely who ſo weigheth this preſent worcke, ſhal thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke that he rather thondreth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, than ſpeaketh mannes wordes.</p>
            <p>Numenius an heathen Philoſopher, whan he had red the beginninge of this goſpel, barſt out in to theſe wordes:</p>
            <p>I praie God, I die, if this barbarous fellow haue not comprehended in few wordes, al that our Plato proſequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in ſo manie worckes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:11"/>
            <p>He called him barbarous bicauſe he was an hebreu, and in his writinge leaueth traces of his mothers tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, &amp; foloweth not curiouſly the finenes, &amp; proprietes of the greke maner of ſpeakinge, but he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto him aſmuch knowlege, as the moſt famous Philoſopher, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al lerned wittes Plato had, and more ſhortenes in writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a writer of graue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derful thinges of this Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that he was put in to boilinge oile, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out againe vnhurte &amp;c. But it ſhalbe ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs to know, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre that he was one of the moſt excellent, ſingular, &amp; ſpecial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp; therefore a mete witnes of the Lorde Ieſus.</p>
            <p>In the beginninge) Kinge Dauid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired from aboue teacheth in the third pſal. that to ſaue pertaineth to Iehoua. The prophete Eſaie moued by the ſame ſpirite in the .45. cha. hath theſe wordes: Iſrael is ſaued i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iehoua, whith a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> In which cha. alſo God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of himſelfe, ſaith thus: A iuſt God and one that ſaueth there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me. And in the prophete Hoſea, he
<pb facs="tcp:26560:11"/> beareth in the ſame, ſaiynge, thou ſhalt know no god beſides me, &amp; there is no ſaueor beſides me. And in Hieremie he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accurſed, that ſhal truſt in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; make fleeſhe his arme, which wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraine vs to ſeke ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſaue in God. But we al ſeke ſaluation at the handes of the lorde Ieſus, we al ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege him to be the ſaueor of the world. We muſt tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of neceſſitee know him to be god, onles we wil forge, and mainteine a faith not agreynge to god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des worde. And that vndoutedly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Meſſias, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father aeternally ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed to be the ſaueor of the world, is God, the holie ſcripture beareth witnes moſt plainly, that we ſhuld be certaine that we ſwarue not from god, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him. For the kinglie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Dauid in the .45. pſal. where with a notable ſonge he celebrateth the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Meſſias, ſaieth thus: Thy throne o God is for euer. In which wordes he giueth him not only the name of God, but alſo confeſſeth his throne to be euer laſtinge. Now noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes throne is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for euer ſauinge goddes only.</p>
            <p>Eſaie in the .9. cha. calleth him el gibbor
<pb facs="tcp:26560:12"/> a ſtronge god, and in the ſame cha. he teacheth that there is no meaſure, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of his kingdom. The prophete Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eremie to take awaie al cauillations, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth expreſly that he is Iehouah, which name is neuer giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor can be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue to the true God only, the autor and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raine of al beinge. For theſe be his wordes: Beholde the daies comme ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Iehoua, and I wil raiſe vp to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid a iuſt bloſom, and a kinge ſhal raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; do wiſely, &amp; ſhal exequute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and righteouſnes in the erth. In his daies Iehuda ſhalbe ſaued, and Iſrael ſhal dwel ſafely &amp; this is his name which thei ſhal cal him, Iehoua our righteouſnes. And this confirmeth the prophete Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, where god ſpeaketh thus: But I will haue pitie on the houſe of Iuda, and wil ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Iehoua their God.</p>
            <p>In the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this matter is taught moſt clearely. For theſe be. S. Paules wordes in the .9, to the Ro. who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe be the fathers, and of whom is Chriſt after the fleſch, who is ouer al god bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for euer. And in the .2. to the Philip Let the ſame minde be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Ieſu, who beinge in
<pb facs="tcp:26560:12"/> the forme of god thought it not robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be equal with god, and yet emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied him ſelfe, takinge the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uant &amp;c. Thus S Paule teacheth that he is not god by vſurpation, but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that he was, and euer is, &amp; ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be in the forme and ſtate of god, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie god, as whan he ſaieth that he toke the forme of a ſeruant, he meaneth that he entred in to the ſtate of a ſeruant, and became a verie ſeruant. Some wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſpirites wreſt this place verie bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, &amp; vngodly. For thei ſaie that S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le reacheth no more, but that the lorde Ieſus was humble, and contente with his ſtate, and aſpired not farther, ne went aboute to climme vp vniuſtly to an aequalitee with god. But if that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the meaninge, whan. S. Paule ſaieth, that beinge in the forme of God, he thought not to make himſelfe equal to god by robberie, he ſhuld ſignifie that beinge in that ſtate that he was in, he might haue ſo do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; haue preuailed. Or els what great matter had it be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he abſtained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to haue go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboute, or to haue thought vpon, had ben more than mere madnes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:13"/>
            <p>Wherefore it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that this theire deuiſe, is the verie rauinge of ſicke brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beſide that they ſhameleſly wringe theſe wordes out of their natural ſenſe, he thought it no robberie to be aequal with God, &amp; make them ſignifie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thei wil or no, he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no robberie, or he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aboute no robberie thinkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to make him ſelfe aequal to god, in ſuch a ſenſe, as thei neuer knew before, nether wil abide, o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>les they be haled clea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne out of iointe. S. Paules meaninge is this, that the lorde Ieſus bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge verie god yet couered his glorious maieſtie with the ſhape &amp; ſtate of a ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled him ſelfe vnto the death of the croſſe, to do vs good, which exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple he ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, to folow, &amp; not to be aſhamed to abaſe our ſelues to the welth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me not only a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo a ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and not that only but more ouer to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to a moſt vile, &amp; ſhameful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath. Now the higher he was, the more liuelier his exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is to moue vs, &amp; to
<pb facs="tcp:26560:13"/> make vs aſhamed of our diſdainfulnes. And therefore, S. Paule ſpeaketh of his godhead, which he had &amp; hath natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we maie know, that his hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge camme not by force, but of his awne good wil. Where I haue turned this worde (alla) which ſignifieth but, in to theſe wordes, &amp; yet, I haue marcked that. S. Paule ſo vſeth the word (alla) in manie places. One ſhal ſuffice, for this time, in the .6. to the Cor. he ſpeaketh thus. For though you haue innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leaders in chriſt, alla, but not manie fathers, that is to ſaie, yet not manie fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers. To returne to our purpoſe. S. Paule in the .14. to the Ro. applieth this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Eſaie: Euerie knee ſhal bow vnto me &amp;c. to the lorde Ieſus, with the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe wordes: we muſt al be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted befo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeate of Chriſt. For it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as truly as I liue ſaieth the lorde, euerie knee ſhal bow vnto me &amp;c. But it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that thoſe wordes ar ſpoken of Iehoua, in the prophete, &amp; ſo muſt the lorde Ieſus be Iehoua. For thes be the wordes of that prophetie in the 45. cha. Am not I Iehoua, &amp; there is no god be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me, a iuſt God, &amp; one that ſaueth
<pb facs="tcp:26560:14"/> there is none beſides me. Loke vnto me, and be ſaued al ye endes of the erth; for I am god, and there is no more, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſworne by my ſelfe, the word is gon out of my mouth in righteouſnes, that euerie knee ſhal bow doune vnto me &amp;c. Againe. S. Paule in the ninth to the Ro. teacheth that the lord Ieſus is the ſtomblinge blocke, and the ſtone where at the lues ſhulde fal, which thinge the prophete Eſaie ſpeaketh of Iehouah.</p>
            <p>For thus he writeth: you ſhal ſanctifie Iehoua the lorde of hoſtes. And he ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be a ſanctuarie, and a ſtone to ſtomble at, &amp; a rocke to ſal at, to bothe the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Iſrael a ſnare, and a trappe to the in dweller of Ieruſalem. And manie ſhal ſtomble in them, or amonge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhall ſal, and be bruſed, &amp; ſnared, and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare Eſaie, and Paule together, and you ſhal ſee, that the lorde Ieſus is Iehoua, as S. Paule colde vndreſtande the ſcriptures, who was ſure that he had goddes ſpirite.</p>
            <p>The Angel alſo in. S. Luke ſaieth, that Iohan Baptiſte ſhuld turne manie of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael to the lorde their god, and that he ſhulde goe before him in the ſpirite, &amp; power of Elias. But the lord
<pb facs="tcp:26560:14"/> Ieſus him ſelfe teacheth, that Iohans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to goe before his face, alleginge the texte of the prophete Malaki, after this ſorte in the .11. of Matheu: beholde I ſende myne Angel before thy face, which ſhal prepare thy waie before the. So muſt the lorde Ieſus be the Lorde god of the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p>But this matter is no where taught with greater clearnes, light, &amp; grace, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this goſpel of S. Io. For in the firſt parte of his firſt cha. ſpeaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the true Meſſias, namely of the lord Ieſus our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſaueor, that our faith might ſafely reſt in him, and that we might know it to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant to the truth of goddes word, &amp; that we make not fleſh our arme wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we putte our truſt in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſaieth, that he was euer goddes worde <abbr>vtue</abbr>, &amp; wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he was with god &amp; that he was verie god, &amp; that al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges were made bi hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. here indede our wittes ar dafeld, &amp; amaſed, here ariſe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie thoughtes. For here two be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god I ſaie, &amp; goddes worde, &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de is ſaid to be god, &amp; to be with god. It ſemeth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes haſtie reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there be two goddes. But the truth is, that there is but one god.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:15"/>
            <p>Wherefore ſome haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo boide, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo mad, as to denie the godhead of the lorde Ieſus, &amp; to bringe him in to the ordre of creatures, &amp; to faine him a made God, leſt there ſhuld be two natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goddes. For they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide no more of god, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de with their litle wittes.</p>
            <p>But we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre that god is beſt knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea only knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him ſelfe, &amp; we muſt thinke him to be ſuch, as he hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfe hath opened vnto vs, that he is, &amp; not ſuch as we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine him, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him. Now he hath taught vs that there is one god, the father, the ſonne, &amp; the holie goſt. That the father is god, the ſonne is god, the holie goſt is god, &amp; yet not three goddes, but one god. Three diſtinctions, three proprietes, &amp; as the good fathers ſpeake, three perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be in the godhead, he him ſelfe hath taught vs, by his ſpecial inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſent by him in to the world, to teach the aſſured truth. And it foloweth not in dede herevpon, that there be three goddes. For theſe three haue one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, (if it be lawful to vſe that terme in this matter,) one eſſence, one beinge.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:15"/> I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te it ſhuld folow, that there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re three goddes, if they were three ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diuided ſubſtances. But now the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and eſſence is one, and they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not therein, they differ only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietes, and perſons. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietee of the father, that he is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; head ſpringe of al, &amp; begetteth his ſonne. This is the propriete of the ſonne, that he ſhineth from the father, iſſueth and ſpringeth out of him, and is begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him. This is the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the holie goſt, that he procedeth from the father, and the ſonne. If anie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil aſke how this trinitee, can bein a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnitee, &amp; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnitee in a trinitee, the ſame declareth, that he wil not be ſatiſfied, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>til he haue e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred in to the ſecretes of god and know al that is in god, and be as wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe as god, and comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that, that is infinite, and vnmeaſurable within the ſmal compaſſe of his franticke head, and ſo in dede ſhew him ſelfe to raue, and to be more mete, to be placed in bedleem, than in the companie of Chriſtiane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whan god hath once clarely and certai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaied it, it is our parte to thincke it to be, as he hath ſaide it to be. For
<pb facs="tcp:26560:16"/> ſurely it maie be, &amp; it is, whan he hath plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſaide it, though our reaſon ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <abbr>nev</abbr> reach it. And that god hath ſaid this with cleare wordes, it ſhal moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeare out of. S. Ioannes doctrine, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhalbe weighed. For I doubte not but that we al acknowlege, that what ſo. S. Io. ſaieth, god ſaieth. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know that god hath certai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſaid it, we wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it, though it ſeme neuer ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pugnant to reaſon. For we refuſe not al that is repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to reaſon, but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame is repugnant to goddes worde.</p>
            <p>And to ſaie the truth this matter is not ſo much repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to reaſon, as it is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the reach of reaſon.</p>
            <p>In the beginninge was the word</p>
            <p>The word was in the beginninge. By the worde the euangeliſte meaneth, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de perſon in the holie trinitee, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly our lorde Ieſus Chriſt touchinge his diuine nature, as it appeareth afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaieth, &amp; the word became fleſh. Here we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre why goddes ſonne is called a worde. Auncia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre a worde two waies. For thei teach that there is an outwarde worde, &amp; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inwarde worde. The outward word
<pb facs="tcp:26560:16"/> is that ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, &amp; paſſeth awaie. The in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde worde is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipte of the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, which remaineth ſtil in the herte, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is paſt. So thei ſaie that god hath an outwarde worde, which is ſounded, pronounced &amp; writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, &amp; that he hath an inwarde worde, which remaineth with in him ſelfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the outwarde worde is an image, effecte, &amp; frute. This inwarde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de euer remaininge in him is called his ſonne, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipte of the herte maie be called the enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred frute of the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and the hertes childe.</p>
            <p>Thei thincke alſo that he is called the worde of god, bicauſe that as a worde is the image of mannes minde, &amp; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it vnto vs, ſo the Lorde Ieſus is goddes image, and moſt liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth vnto vs his power, his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, and his wiſedom.</p>
            <p>For what ſo euer is in the father ſhineth in the ſonne. Some other thincke that the worde here is taken for a thinge, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the hebrue maner of ſpeakinge.</p>
            <p>For the hebrues vſe (DABAR) which ſignifieth a word for a thinge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:17"/>
            <p>Whan Eſaie the prophete aſked kinge <hi>Ezechias,</hi> what the Embaſſadors of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon had ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his houſe, he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus: They ſaw al that was in myn houſe, lo haiah dabar, there was not a worde, that is to ſaie anie one thinge, that I ſhewed not vnto them in my treaſures. The prophete replieth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the daies comme, that what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is in thy houſe ſhalbe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaye, &amp; what ſo euer thy fathers haue laied vp in ſtoare vnto this daie, ſhalbe caried to Babilon lo ijvather dabar, there ſhal not a worde remaine ſaieth the lorde, that is to ſaie, there ſhal not one thinge be left behinde. The angel alſo in. S. Luke whan the Virgine Marie mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed how ſhe ſhuld conceaue a childe without mannes helpe, ſaid vnto hir, no worde ſhalbe impoſſible vnto god, that is, no thinge ſhalbe impoſſible for him to do. So than after this underſtandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge S. Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes meaninge is, that in the beginninge there was a diuine, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie thinge with god.</p>
            <p>The greke vocable, logos, which S. Iohan. vſeth, hath ſondrie ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and amonge other beſide co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:17"/> and talke, it ſignifieth reaſon, and wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſingificacion agreeth ryght wel. For Salomon calleth that thing wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e that was with God beefore the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the world was laied, and that was Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before him, that is to ſaie, as the Hebreues expoune the worde, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector. For by that wiſdome God made all thinges, and doeth all thinges, as it is there expreſſed, by me kinges raigne, &amp; Princes enacte righteouſnes &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Surely in my minde S. Iohn hath reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the firſt cha. of Geneſis, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame vnto vs. For Moſes ſaith not ſimply, that God made all thynges of noughte, but that he ſpake, and made thinges, that is to ſaie, that he made all thinges by his worde. By the worde than I vnderſtande Goddes vertue, and power, wherby he hath opened, and as it were ſet abrode himſelfe in makynge all thinges, &amp; in preſeruing &amp; maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their ſtate, &amp; finally in repai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring, reſtoring, and renuing them being decaied thorough ſinne. For as a worde vttereth, and bringeth forth that, that is in the hearte, ſo by this woorde, this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:18"/> &amp; vertue of god, is vttered brought forth, and ſette abrode, that laie hydden in god before. So that I thinke that he is called goddes worde, both bicauſe he is gods wyſdome, and gods image, repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyng all that is in the father, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſecrete vertue, and power of God, wherby god vttereth, ſhewethe oute, and ſendeth foorth that is in hym, namely hys might, and wiſedome in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king all thinges, his goodnes in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them, and his mercy indeclaring to mortal men his wil, and pleaſure, and in recouering and ſauing them being loſt. only let vs beware, that we take not this vocable (word, groſly for a word ſoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, pronounced, or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſencial perſon ſubſiſting, and abiding in God, and than whether we vnderſtande the worde to be gods image, and bright<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, gods vertue and power, or goddes wiſdome, we ſhall not doe amyſſe. For the holy ſcripture giueth al theſe things to the ſeconde perſon in the moſt ſacred trinite. In the beginning) that is before the world was made for ſo we learne in Salomon. Iehoua poſſeſſed me in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb facs="tcp:26560:18"/> of his waye, before his workes Meaz. from than, that is to ſaye eternall<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. And than he goeth forth, meolam, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer I was ſtablyſhed, from the head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginninges of the earth. Bee in the homoth in not depes, that is wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the depts were not, I was conceaued, be ein maienoth, in not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, that is wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fountaines were not yet laden wyth twaters. Before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines was layed, before the hilles I was conceaued. Yet he had not made the erth and the outward partes of it, &amp; the head that is the beginning of the duſt of the world. Whan he prepared the heauens, I was there. &amp;c. hitherto we haue reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the holy goſtes wordes out of Salo. prouerbes. And I thynke more ſondrye wordes can not bee deuiſed to expreſſe that gods wiſdome, euen the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, touching his diuine nature, was with God before any creature had his beyng. And in dede ſith the Lord Ieſus, in that he is gods ſonne is gods wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pheme God, that imagine anye tyme whan he was not: For ſo they imagine a tyme whan GOD was wythoute wyſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. We haue another place of the
<pb facs="tcp:26560:19"/> ſcripture, that teacheth vs thus to vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtande, in the beginning. For in the .17. cha. of this goſpell, the Lorde hymſelfe ſaieth: glorifie me father at thi ſelf, with the glory, which I had before the world was with thee. he that had glorie before the worlde was made, was, and had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge beefore the worlde was made. For that, that is nothing, cannot haue glory while it is nothing. WAS) It is euidente that S. Iohns intente is in this chap. to ſhewe what goddes ſonne is touchinge his ſubſtance, eſſence and being. And if he had been a creature, here had been a place of neceſſite, to ſhewe that he was made. But he ſaith not that he was made yea he ſaieth that he was alreadye, and had his beeing before any creature was made. And ſo he is exempted out of the nomber of creatures.</p>
            <p>And theſe two woordes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and was, confounde two heretikes, Cerinthus, and Arius. Whan Cerinthus ſhall ſwiniſhly grunte that the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus was a pure ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and had his begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of Ioſeph, and Mary, we maye ſtopp hys mouth with this worde in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:19"/> For he that was in the beginninge was not to be begone in the tyme of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and Mary. Whan Arrius ſhal blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly iangle, and peuiſhlye bable, that he is a creature, we ſhall putte hys rude talke to ſilence, wyth thys woorde, was. For he that was alreadye in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, before any thing was made, &amp; had his beeing beefore the creation of thinges, was neuer made. And this voca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble (the worde) bindeth both theſe here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tikes together in a bondle and throweth them down to hell. For eyther to ſaye that Goddes worde was not eternallye, or that Goddes worde is a creature, is to ſay that God was ſome tyme withoute his wiſdome, and power, or to ſaye that God had no wiſedome, vntyll he hadde made it. For it is manifeſte out of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that Goddes worde is his wiſdome For there it is taughte, that all thynges were made by hys wiſedome, and here we are taughte, that all thynges were made by his worde. So his wiſedome, &amp; his worde muſte be all one. And than ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not his worde be a creature. For GOD was neuer, nor neuer ſhalbe without his
<pb facs="tcp:26560:20"/> wiſdome. But the Arrians make an argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment wherby they thynk to ouerthrow all. That ſay they, that begetteth is bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, that is begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the father begetteth, ergo he is before the ſonne, that is begotten. To thys firſt I anſwere that they, which will ſhewe thynges vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>create, by thinges create, ſhal ſometimes ſhewe themſelues very fooles. Secondly I anſwere that the argumente is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes true, in thinges create. For lyght ſpringeth out of the ſunne, and therfore we mai ſay, that the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne begetteth light and heate iſſueth out of fier, and yet the ſunne is not before his lighte, nor fyer before heate. But aſſone as the ſunne is lyght is alſo, and aſſone as fier is, heate is The ſunne goeth before hys lyghte, fier before heate in order, nor in tyme. And ſo we may ſay, that the father is before hys ſonne, god is before his wyſedome in order, not in tyme. In order, beecauſe wiſdome ſpringeth from the father, not in time, becauſe the father is neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his wiſedome. But yet thei blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, whether the father be gatt the ſonne, whan he was, or wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was not, thinking whatſoeuer ſhall bee
<pb facs="tcp:26560:20"/> anſwered, to ſhewe an abſurdyte. Wher indede the demaund is moſt abſurd, and peuiſhe. For we wyll demaunde of them agayne, whether fier begette heate bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heate is in it, or after. If they ſaye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, than they graunte that fier is ſome tyme without heate, which is impoſſible For it is no fier that hath no heate. If thei ſay after, than we will ſaye as they ſaye, that the begettyng of heate is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſyth heate was there before. Againe we myght aſke them, whether god wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was became god, or became god bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was. But we delight not in ſuch vaine queſtions, wherewyth idle wittes ſporte their follies. But briefely to them we ſay, that it is no abſurdite to affirme that the father begetteth his ſonne alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy being, bicauſe the ſonne is euer in him &amp; ſpringeth euer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, no more than it is an abſurdite to ſay, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mynde begetteth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe reaſon is in it &amp; ſpri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. And yet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is no ſoner, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is. But theſe great clerks ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine none other begetti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s groſſe begetti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo abſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dites folow not our doctri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, but their dre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs. For our doctri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of gods ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, &amp; of
<pb facs="tcp:26560:21"/> begetting, is farre from the groſſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacion of mans, or beaſtes fleſhlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting. There is nothyng in oure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne but heauenly, and ſpirituall. And theſe menne are altogether drowned in fleſhe, and ſpeake nothing but fleſhe, &amp; fleſhly thinges.</p>
            <p>I wyll rehearſe another argumente of theirs, that the ſimple, and vnlearned be not perchance combred, and amaſed with their ſophiſtications. Otherwiſe I think all their reaſons rather to be buryed in perpetual ſilence and darkenes, and to be in dede ſo many blaſphemies, as they bee reaſons. For they aſke whether God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſonne withoute conſideracyon or conſideringe and willinge. If neyther conſidering, nor wylling, than ſaye they he ſuffred ſomewhat, that he would not If conſidering, and willing, than his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſideracion, and will wente before his ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neracion.</p>
            <p>But as before we may diſcouer their extreme folly with another demaunde. For we may aſke whether God be good and mercifull of hys owne wil, or agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt his will. For if he be good, and mercifull
<pb facs="tcp:26560:21"/> of his own will, and wil goeth before all thinges, that are choſen by wil, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was a time or ſpace, whan God was not yet good, and mercifull, but conſulted, &amp; toke deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboute thoſe thynges. Item we may demaunde of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the father be God of his will, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will. If of his will, than after theſe mens high wittes, his wil went be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore his eſſence, and beeing. If agaynſte his will, who conſtrayned him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſeeth not nowe the outragious madnes, and extre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e franſie of theſe wilde ſpirits For in dede in naturall thynges no will goeth beefore, whiche will hath place only in thoſe thinges that bee withoute the ſubſtaunce of him, that taketh deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But here we wil make an end of this lecture. Let theſe words of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geliſt my brethren which we now haue treated ſinke depelye into your heartes, which weighe downe ſo greate hereſies and teache vs ſo excellent, and ſo diuine thinges, as the angels can not attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to. Let vs conſider how great goodneſſe of God this is, that he hath vouchſafed to open vnto vs the moſte reuerende tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:26560:22"/> of his diuine maieſtie, and lette vs prayſe hys holy name therfore, and bee thankefull.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ANd the word was wyth God. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the worlde was made, there was nether time, nor place. And therfore the worde beeing a thyng ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtinge in the beginninge beefore any thing was made, could be no where but with god, and in god. For than ther was nothing but God. And ſo he muſt nedes be of the ſame ſubſtance that god is of. For if he were not of the ſame ſubſtance and yet was in the beginning, that is to ſay euer a thing ſubſiſtinge with God, than the proprietes of God ſhoulde be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. The proprietes of God ar to be infinite, and to be omnipotent. But if they were two ſondrie diuided ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neyther of them ſhoulde be infinite, nor omnipotent. For where the one wer
<pb facs="tcp:26560:22"/> the other ſhold not be, nor where the po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer of the one, the power of the other. Their ſubſtance than of neceſſite, muſte be one, and the ſame, and yet theſe words ſhewe manifeſtly a difference in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. For it were a great abſurdite to ſal the worde was with god, if there wer no maner of difference betwene god, and the word. For who can ſay of one thing hauing no maner of difference, that that thing hath a thyng wyth it. Who canne ſaye without abſurdite in ſuche a ringe there is a diamonde, and in the diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de or with the diamonde, there is a diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſpeaking of one only diamond. Thus we may ſay, in ſuch a ring there is a diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and in the diamonde a point, a raſe, or a vertue to take awaye the power of the adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtone for there is ſome differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the point, the raſe, &amp; the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; the diamonde it ſelfe. So tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſay a thing is with a thing, there is a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the thing with which it is, and the thing that is with it. Theſe words therfore forceably ouerthrowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hereſie, namely of Sabellius, who affirmed, that there was no diſtinction of perſons in the Godhead.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:23"/>
            <p>And that theſe woordes the father, the ſonne, and the holy goſt were only ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie titles, and names geuen to one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as one and the ſelfe ſame man may ſome times be called tall, ſome times fayre, and ſome times valiant &amp;c. So he mingled and conſounded altogether, teachynge that god the father was ſometimes called the father, ſometimes the ſonne, and ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e times the holy goſt.</p>
            <p>But we holde leaning to the euidente trueth of Gods worde, theſe three diſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theſe three ſondrie perſons, vnmin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gled, and vnconfounded, ſo that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not the ſonne, nor the ſonne the holy goſt, or the father. As in the ſunne that ſhineth ouer vs, we ſee three things vnconfounded, and vnmingled. For we conſider the ſunne by it ſelfe, the lighte by it ſelfe, and the heate by it ſelfe. The light is not the ſonne, nor the heate the light, but they be three diſtinct thinges. I ſay nor this as though the material ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n could ſufficiently expreſſe the thinges of the godhead. For no creature can expres that myſtery. Yea no corporal thyng can expreſſe a ſpirituall, and mindly thynge.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:23"/> But I ſpeake it to ſhewe you ſome waye, for the ſtayeng of vnquiet heades, that ſondrie thynges maye be in one vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and vnmingled, that is euerye one abiding ſtill in his propre nature.</p>
            <p>Now that theſe three diſtinctions be in the godhead I wyll brieflye ſhewe you out of gods worde. And firſte I wyll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne wyth the holy goſte. In the .14. of thys goſpell the Lorde himſelfe ſayeth: I wyll entreate the father, and he ſhall geue you another comforter. This word another, noteth a difference betwene the ſonne, and the holy goſt. For it can not be ſayd of one, and the ſame hauige no difference that he is another beſydes hym ſelfe. Agayne ſpeakyng of the holy goſt in the .16. cha. he ſhall receaue, ſayeth the Lorde Ieſus, of myne, and ſhal ſhew forth vnto you.</p>
            <p>Theſe wordes alſo declare a plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference betwene the ſonne and the holye goſt. For he coulde not haue ſayed, he ſhall take of myne, if there had not been a difference betwene hym that taketh, and him from whom he taketh.</p>
            <p>Nowe a difference both betwene the
<pb facs="tcp:26560:24"/> ſonne and the holy goſt, &amp; alſo betwene the father &amp; the holy goſt, may be eaſely and plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly gathered out of theſe words: whan the comforter ſhall come, whom I wil ſende vnto you from the father, the ſpirite of trueth, which procedeth from the father, he ſhal witnes of me. For ther is a difference betwene him that ſendeth and him that is ſent, &amp; there is a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene him that procedeth, &amp; him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he procedeth. And that there is a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the father, and the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne theſe wordes of the Lorde Ieſus teach vs ſufficiently, I &amp; the father HEN ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN are one. For the plural no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth two. If there had been no diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene the father, &amp; the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, he ſholde haue ſaid I &amp; the fatheram one, &amp; not ar one. Theſe wordes alſo that we haue in hande, the worde was with God, proue the ſame ineuitably, as I haue ſaid.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt warne you of another er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you heare that the worde is with god, &amp; ſpringeth out of god the father, ye imagine not that he departeth and is diuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father, &amp; is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a part. For our former example of
<pb facs="tcp:26560:24"/> the ſunne maye teache you that, that is not of neceſſite. For lighte is with the ſunne, &amp; iſſueth out of the ſunne, &amp; yet departeth not, ne is diuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne And though no example could ſhadow the matter vnto vs, yet the trueth is, that goddes ſonne is ſo with god, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God, and ſo ſpringeth from God, that he abydeth ſtill in God. For Goddes nature admytteth no diuiſion.</p>
            <p>And the word was God. As the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence beefore ſheweth a difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene God the father, and the ſonne in their perſons, ſo thys teacheth an vnitie in ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>For ſith there is but one God, the ſonne beeyng God, as S. Iohn clearely te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth, that we myghte bee ſure of the ſonnes diuinite, he muſt nedes be of the ſame ſubſtance, that the father is of. Els ether there ſhould be ſondri gods, or the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſhoulde not be naturally God. But the wordes that goe beefore, and theſe wordes, and the words that folow which aſſigne to the ſonne the makyng of all thinges, proue that he is naturally God.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:25"/> For what is eternall and without begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, but god? what was wyth god bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was made, that was not god? how coulde Iohn ſpeakynge of the nature of a thing, that was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, affirme it to be god, onles it were god? For what ſubſtance could there be before any thing was made, that was ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther gods ſubſtance, nor a creature. For what ſo is not a creature, and yet hath a being, is ſurely god. And whereby were all thynges made but by god? For Eſaie teacheth that god vſed no miniſter in makyng the worlde, whan he ſaieth I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone extended the heauens by my ſelfe. But he made all thinges by hys ſonne, therefore his ſonne muſte be hymſelfe, that is to ſaye of the ſame ſubſtance, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and being. And that there can not be two gods, we haue alreadi proued by gods propretes, and all the ſcripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirmeth the ſame. But it is moſt vehemently taughte in theſe wordes of Eſaie: is there a God beſyde me? Before me there was no god framed, nor ſhalbe after me. The ſonne than beyng natural<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly god, muſt nedes be of the ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:26560:25"/> and eſſence that the father is of and ſo though the father be naturally God, the ſonne naturally God &amp;c. yet there bee not three Goddes, but one God, becauſe the ſubſtance of thoſe three is one. Theſe wordes alſo, the worde was God, choke another hereſie in my opinion more ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tile than the hereſie of Arrius. For Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Samoſatenus and his ſcolars grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te that the worde was euer with God, but by the worde they vnderſtand not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance, a ſubſiſting eſſence but only gods purpoſe which he had eternally to make the world, and to make him a ſonne out of the virgin Mary, that ſhoulde bee a moſt excellent man, and the ſaueoure of the worlde. But how can a hare purpoſe to doe thinges bee called God, whan it hath no ſubſiſting and abiding nature? Forther theſe wretches ſee not that by their ſtrange and worſe than Platonical imagination, thei make trees, and ſtones and wormes equall to Goddes ſonne in eternite. For they were euer in gods pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe. And yet I thinke they wil ſticke to call them gods.</p>
            <p>But though thys ſentence of S. Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:26560:26"/> be ſufficient to holde their noſes to the grinde ſtone, yet take that with you alſo that is written in the .17. chap. of this worke, glorifie me father with the glori which I had before the worlde was with thee.</p>
            <p>What glorie coulde an onely purpoſe without ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue before the world was with God? Yea how could he be, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the world, if he were in Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only? For ſo was the worlde euer with God. How could he reioyce before him whan nothing was yet made, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon teacheth, if he were than but in hys purpoſe? Nether could this be truly ſayed, before Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, I am, if he wer in the beginning, but onely in Goddes purpoſe, for ſo was Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer in gods purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For God beginneth not newe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and purpoſes. But his purpoſes are eternal, &amp; altogether, &amp; he nedeth not time to deuiſe &amp; purpoſe one thing after another, which is mans weakneſſe. For he ſeeth all that he wil dooe at once with one ſight, whiche if we coulde doe
<pb facs="tcp:26560:26"/> we would not take one counſell after a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother. But oure weakneſſe compelleth vs ſo to doe, whiche is farre from God, and therefore all his purpoſes be in him together, &amp; at once. But ſith his ſonne was in him before Abraham, it muſte nedes be, that he was otherwiſe in him, than in purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And in dede he that is euer in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and beeinge, maye well be ſaied to bee before him, that was onely euer in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and not in ſubſtance, and verie bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing. Thus thys hereſye alſo laieth flatte vpon the grounde with out life, or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>This was in the beginninge with GOD.) The Grekes haue a prouerbe that the thing that is faire, and goodly maye bee repeted once or twiſe. Saincte Iohn repeteth the verye thinge, that he ſpake before. And thys he dooeth not ſuperfluouſlie, but vpon greate purpoſe For he will depelie printe in to vs, that GODDES woorde is eternall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute beginninge, and no creature.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:27"/>
            <p>As if he would ſay thinke not that this fell from me inconſideratly whan I ſaied the worde was in the beginninge, and ſaied not, that it was made. For, that you may be aſſured for euer of my meaning and of the trueth of the matter, I ſaye to you againe, that the worde was in the beginning, and had his beyng before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing was made. That the word I ſay was eternallye with God, and is no crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. For it was euer with God, and had euer his beeing. This is the diligence of our holy writers, that whan a thing is of great weight, and importance thei will beate it in twiſe, that it maye ſticke the faſter.</p>
            <p>Althinges) he hath ſhewed vs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance, eſſence and being of the lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, nowe he teacheth vs to know hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his workes. For he ſayth that al thinges ware made by him And if all things wer made by him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt nedes be god. For God himſelf ſaieth in the .44. of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, I am Iehoua the maker of al thinges, I only extende the heauens and ſtretche forth the earth by my ſelf. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Dauid ſaieth that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wer
<pb facs="tcp:26560:27"/> made, and ſtabliſhed by Goddes worde and this place teſtifieth, that all thynges were made by it, ſo Goddes worde muſt nedes be God, foraſmuche as God made al thinges alone by himſelfe, and yet by his worde.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt beware of ſondrye cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of the ſcripture. For ſome peuiſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and dronkenlye affirme, that. S. Iohn ſpeaketh of God the father, when he ſaith that al thinges were made by him, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Greke pronowne is indifferent to be interpreted by it or by hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the word (logos) being the maſculine ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. But how weriſhe a thing were this, &amp; howe farre beſide the purpoſe, if going about to teache what we ſhold thinke of gods ſonne and of his nature he ſhould write thus: Goddes ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne was in the beginning with God, and was God, he was in the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning with God and all thinges were made by him, that is to ſaye by God the father, what were this to his purpoſe, which is to ſhewe vs what Goddes ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is, if he ſhould tell vs that God the father made al thinges? But. S. Paule ſhal make theſe dreamers to bluſhe, and defeate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:26560:28"/> of there miſerable ſhifte, to the ſighte of very childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For to the coloſſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth thus: geuinge thankes to the father, who hath made vs mete to be partakers of the lott of the ſainctes in lighte, who hath deliuered vs oute of the power of darknes, and remoued vs into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his beloued ſonne, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue redempcion thorowe his blood, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, which is the image of the inuiſible God, the firſt begotten of e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uery creature. For in hym or by him wer all thinges made, thinges in heauen and thinges in earth. Therfore, ſaieth ſaincte Paule, he is the firſt begotten of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe all thinges were made by him.</p>
            <p>Theſe wordes can not bee wreſted, but that they ſhall teache that all things were made by the diuine nature of the Lorde Ieſus, and ſo they ſhall ſerue to ſhewe plainly. S. Iohns meaning, beſide that the threed of his purpoſe leadeth vs there vnto.</p>
            <p>The Arrians as falſly, but more ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye ſaie, that God made all thinges yb
<pb facs="tcp:26560:28"/> the woorde in dede, but that he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by it, as by an inſtrumente, and miniſter. But they ſee not, that ſo they blaſpheme both God the father, and his ſonne. If God coulde not make the worlde but by an inſtrumente, and miniſter, his power is pinched, and cutte ſhorte. And if the worde were but an inſtrumente onely, and miniſter of anothers will, the glory therof is greatly diminiſhed. We ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore that God the father made the world by his word working equally together with him.</p>
            <p>The good fathers haue laboured to teache vs this matter by ſimilitudes, as heate, ſay they, worketh together wyth the fier, and odour with a flower. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit they confeſſe that no ſimilitude ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of thinges create, canne ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie expreſſe the thinge. But thoughe no earthly thing canne expreſſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the thinge we are ſure, namelye that the father worketh together equal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie with the ſonne, and the ſonne equal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye with the father, and that GOD vſed no mynyſter in makynge of the

            <p>And that God vſed no inſtrument, or miniſter in making thinges, he himſelfe teacheth in Eſaye, as I haue ſhewed you, by theſe words (any Ieuadi, I alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende the heauens &amp;c. and MEITTI, of my ſelfe, or by my ſelfe. Thus whan we ſay God made all thinges, we exclud not the ſonne, and whan we ſay al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs wer made by the ſonne, we exclude not the father, and the holy goſt, but meane that they wroughte, and euer worke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually together.</p>
            <p>And where the Arrians bid vs marke that whan the ſcriptures ſpeake of the ſonne in making, and working, thei vſe this worde by whom, and not of whom, we anſwere that the ſcriptures ſpeaking of the fathers woorkinge, vſe alſo this worde by whom. God is faythfull ſaieth S. Paul, by whom you are called to the fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowſhip of his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> And to the.

<pb facs="tcp:26560:29"/> for whom are all thinges, and by whom are al thinges. &amp;c. And (of whom) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo applyed to the ſonne, as in the .4. to the Ephe. That we maye growe into hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is the head, of whom the hole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beeing coupled, and ioyned &amp;c. But ſome will ſay, that. S. Paul ſpeaketh not there of making of creatures, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his congregacion. I anſwer that it is no leſſe worke of Gods omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to make a ſpirituall man, and a good man, than to make a man, yea. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſaieth that it is a greater thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. And if the Lord Ieſus be the aurthor of, good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in man, that is to ſay of that, that is beſt in man, than is he able inough to be the authour of that, that is lower and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quireth les power to be made. So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he is the maker, and worker of thinges, not as an inſtrumente, but as an author of whom, and by whom thynges procede. And than I propone this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente to oure newe Arrians, that, that maketh things, is of another nature, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thinges that bee made. But Goddes ſonne made al things, ſo is he of another nature than the thinges, which he made.

For whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not mad, nor of the nature of thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs made, is God. For there be no more in the worlde nor without the worlde, but god and thinges made. And whatſoeuer is not made, and yet is, is God.</p>
            <p>And with oute it nothing was made that was made.) Thus the ſentence muſt holy goe together. For they that knytte the laſt part to the nexte ſentence thus: that was made in it was life, they are faine to vſe a newe figure of ſpeche, and in dede to corrupte the ſcripture, ſaying that in it was life, is aſmuche to ſay, as it liueth in it. But to liue in Goddes worde and to be life in Gods worde, will not ſo eaſely be made alone. And as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peticion of the ſame woordes, it is no rare thing in Hebrewe writers.</p>
            <p>To our purpoſe, whan. S. Iohn ſaieth that nothing was made withoute it, he ſaieth the very ſame thing that he ſaied, whan he ſaid, that al thinges were made by it, and yet he doeth nothinge vainly but thys repeticion in other woordes, is very neceſſarie, and verye profitable for
<pb facs="tcp:26560:31"/> vs, and geueth vs a ſtronge weapon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte al cauillacions. For in commun ſpeche thys worde (all) comprehendeth not alwaies euery thing particularlye.</p>
            <p>Whan Saincte Luke ſaith, they were al filled with anger in the ſinagoge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, he meaneth not euerye one none except. For ſome loued, and fauoured hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that companye. Saincte Iohn than hath done diligentlye, and wiſelye, and happelye for vs, that he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, onelye to ſaye all thynges were made by it, namelye the woorde, but with a repiticion to vtter the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with ſuche woordes, as leaue no maner of coloure to wranglers. Nether woulde he vſe the worde (OVDEN) whiche ſignifieth nothinge, but ſpeake more ſtraightlye in my opinion, ſaying OVDEHEN, neither one thynge as if he woulde ſay, not ſo muche as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one thing, thoughe it be neuer ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The like diligence and wiſdome was in. S. Paule ſpeakinge of the ſame matter For he thought it not inough to ſaye all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs wer made by the lord, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
<pb facs="tcp:26560:32"/> afterwarde exquiſitely, and almoſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly to diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and patticulary tees ſaying, whether they be thynges in erth, or thinges in heauen, and ſo forth. Now than heare my reaſon: If nothinge were made without him, than he himſelf was not made, onles you wyll raue, and ſaye that he is nothynge or that he made hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſith he is ſome thyng. But he that made all thinges, cannot be nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde he make himſelfe before he was. And he that is already, is not to be made. It is playne than that he was neuer made. And if he wer neuer made, but did make all thynges, than is he certaynlye God.</p>
            <p>But let the Arrians goe a whyle, and lette vs conſider another thinge in theſe wordes. If al thinges were made by hym than all thinges are in hys power. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of than ſhoulde we be afraide, while we mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine his cauſe, and labor to ſerue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

For firſt he ſoundeth from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God hath a worde, ſignifyinge the diuine nature of the lord Ieſus. And here forthwith Arrius ſetteth vp his hornes, and becauſe he cannot frame his witte ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to the worde, he goeth about to frame the worde according to his witte, as the men of Leſbos had ſquires &amp; rules of leade, and whan they coulde not make their hard ſtones agree to their ſquiers, they woulde ſtretche oute their ſquiers, and make them agree to the ſtones. I graunt, ſaieth Arrius that God hath a worde, that is of moſte excellente nature but this worde God made, and there was a time whan the worde was not. Agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt this deuiſe of mans peuiſhe head. S. Iohn thondreth and lightneth, declaring that the worde was in the beginning. Now of a beginning ther is no beginning, for that were not a beginning indede, that had a beginning. But leſt any ſhold ſay that a beginninge ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes ſignifieth order, and not excluding of time, as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſes ſaith in the beginning God made heauen, and earth &amp;c. there lieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Sabellius than, and the patripaſſians, ſteppe foorth, and they ſai that the word was in the beginning in dede, and had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his being. For there is no maner of difference, or diſtinction betwene God the father, and the worde. But. S. Iohn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumeth theſe heretikes with the lightni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of this ſentence, and the worde was with God Paulus Samoſatenus thinketh to perce the heauens, and is lifted vp aboue the cloudes with the winges of pride, &amp; ſaieth that the worde ſignifieth goddes purpoſe only to doe thinges without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſubſiſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; abidi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g nature. But. S Iohn with this ſhotte driueth him down vnto hel, whan he ſaieth the worde was god. For a bare purpoſe hauing no ſubſtance ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be god, ne ſaid to be god. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our moſt diuine euangeliſt, that al the world may lerne the diuinite of the word by his works, ſaith, that al things wer made by the word. Here the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſwete, vexe, &amp; torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, wrigling in and
<pb facs="tcp:26560:34"/> out, and at the laſt they breake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open blaſphemye, and ſaye that God made the worlde by the worde, as by an inſtrument.</p>
            <p>But. S. Iohn vttering the ſame ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againe with other wordes, namely with theſe, and without it was made nothing, ſtoppeth their breath. For if God made the worlde by an inſtrument, and wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worde nothing was made, than the inſtrument was not made without it if the inſtrument wer any thing. And ſo he was not made without himſelfe. But he could not helpe to make himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was. And he that is already, hath no nede to be made. But S. Iohn leaueth them not ſo, but ſtill hurleth fierie fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes againſt their faces. For with greate grace and power he ſaieth, in it was lyfe. From whom procedeth life, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true God onely, of whom it is notablye and ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gularly ſaied, with the is the veine of life. And againe, in him we liue, moue and haue our beeing.</p>
            <p>We may than well make theſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s if Gods ſonne being naturallye life, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life to all thinges by participacyon
<pb facs="tcp:26560:34"/> of him ſelfe, he is another tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges that liue by his preſence. And he that is another thing naturally than a creature, how is not he God? Againe if the ſonne be a creature, how quickneth he al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs and how doeth. S. Paule aſſigne that to God as properly, &amp; peculiarly pertaini<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnto him, whan he ſaieth to Timothe, I charge the in the ſight of God, who quik<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth all thinges. If the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne be a creature and geueth life to all thinges, then a crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture geueth life to it ſelfe. And ſo there ſhall no principall, and peculiar thing be in God aboue a creature. A creature alſo ſhall haue no nede of God for life, ſith it geueth it ſelfe life. But a creature euer hath nede of the creator, ſo the ſonne is not a creature, ſith he is life by himſelfe. Nothing is partaker of it ſelfe, all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges be partakers of the ſonne as of their life, ſo is the ſonne no creature.</p>
            <p>Now let vs returne to our texte. In it was life ſaieth. S. Ihon. For not onely all thinges were made by Goddes woorde of nothing, but alſo all thinges are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in their ſtate by Goddes woorde that thei turne not to nothinge againe.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:35"/> For vndoubtedly al thinges ſhuld decaie &amp; turne againe to their firſt nothinge, if goddes ſonne did not inſpire in to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life, vigor &amp; force of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance. And this parte of goddes worcke, where by al thinges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in their ſtate, is no leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at, than the makinge of thinges. For where as al thinges made, &amp; hauinge a beginni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to an ende, by arte, &amp; conninge, he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certaine immortalitee, &amp; perpetual conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For he hath putte in to thinges ſuch life, vigor, &amp; force of enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dringe, that by ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinges that ſeme to be of a verie ſhorte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manie thouſande yeres, and ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the ende, that he hath appointed.

<pb facs="tcp:26560:35"/> that the life which goddes ſonne giueth to creatures ſhulde be a light to men to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goddes ſonne.

            <p>And the light ſhineth in darknes) gods ſonne geueth great and ample profes of his diuinite, and ſendeth forth the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhining beames of his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly maie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtie, but they light vpon blinde eyes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee them not thoughe they be neuer ſo cleare, and ſo bright. Here. S. Iohn calleth mans vnderſtandinge not onelye darke, but very darknes, as though there were no maner of light in it. But how can that be ſo? Shall we ſaye that there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of light in mans witte, and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wherby ſo mani moſt wittie thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs haue ben inuented? What can bee more wittie than the bokes that heathen men haue left vs of logike phiſicke, arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:36"/> geometrie, aſtronomie and of the nature of all thinges? What can be more wittely deuiſed, than they haue founde out of the fountayne, head ſpring, &amp; firſt cauſes of vertues, of the diuiſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them? Was Plato voide of al light of vnderſtanding, whan he ſayed that God made the worlde becauſe he is good. Was Ariſtotle drowned i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> darknes whan he ſaid that foraſmuche as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioure orbes &amp; ouer bodies doe moue there muſte nedes be a firſt mouer? Was Cicero ſtarke blinde whan he ſaied that ſeing no one familie can continew with out otder and prouidence, muche more the hole worlde muſt be gouerned main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained, and continued by the prouidence of ſome heauenly minde? What ſhall we ſaye of that heathen Philoſopher, that laboureth to proue Gods prouidence by this argument. If God, ſaieth he, gouerne not the world by his prouidence, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he can not, or becauſe he wil not. If you ſaye he can not, you abbrige his power. If you ſay he wil not, you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brige his goodnes.</p>
            <p>To this queſtion than I anſwere that man
<pb facs="tcp:26560:37"/> hath ſo much licht of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge, as is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make him voide of al excuſe, but not ſo much as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> directe him to a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable knowlege of God.

            <p>And the darcknes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it not. The darcknes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge was ſo thicke &amp; groſſe, that though the beames of Goddes ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſhined euerie where, &amp; filled the worlde with light, yet that was fruttles.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:38"/>
            <p>For men ſeeing ſaw not. As Moſes tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in theſe wordes, thy eyes haue ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great ſignes, and wonders, and god hath not geuen thee an heart to vnderſtand, nor eares to heare, nor eyes to ſee. Our ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing then onles God geue new eyes to ſe is no ſeeing. This is a plaine teſtimony that man neuer attaineth to the righte knowledge of God by nature. For being darknes, he beateth of the light, and the light ſhineth vpon the outſide, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not in. Here we muſte ſeke howe this darknes, this blindnes of iudgement is in man, whether he were firſte made darke and blind in heart, or whether dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and blindnes came afterwarde vpon him. For if he were firſt made blind, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no faute in him, if he ſee not the great light, that God ſendeth forth. For he was not made to ſee it. What faute is there in the moale that ſhe ſeeth not the ſunne beames, or in ſtones that they ſee not the ſtarres, ſith they were ſo made as they ſhoulde not ſee. The holy ſcripture teacheth that the firſte man Adam was made after the image of God, that is fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhed with moſt excellent giftes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:38"/> vnderſtanding, and all maner of vertues. He was not than made blinde. But afterwarde through the enuye, and malice of Sathan, and his owne fault, he neglected Gods commaundemente, and ſo loſt thoſe goodly qualitees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came blinde, and begatte blinde childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> namely ſuch as he was himſelfe. This is diligently to be noted, that the faute mal remaine where it is in dede, and not in God, who is the autor of good thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and not of any thinge that is euill, al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though he diſpoſe in dede, and order all the thinges that man hath infected and made euill. For nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe without him. But he appointeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth where and whan euerye man ſhall vtter that euil that is in him: that is in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay, not by Gods workinge, but by hys owne procuring. For God is not the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor of an adulterous, theuiſhe or murthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous minde, and yet no man ſhall put in practiſe the leacherie that boileth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, nor the thefte, and murder that lurketh in his heart as often, and wher &amp; whan he will, but only where and whan God will. And therefore. S. Auguſtyne

For this cauſe we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te not that God willeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil thinges to be don, leſt he ſhulde be thought the autor of euil thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, which is impoſſible, nether grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te we that he willeth euil thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges not to be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that he nilleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be don, leſt he ſhuld be thought impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; not able to ordre me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes euils to his glorie, which is falſe.

            <p>He reproueth the error of the Iues, which toke Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſt for Chriſt. Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beinge naturally liers delight in lies, kiſſe &amp; embraſe them moſt readily. The Iues were readie to beleue that, that was falſe of Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely that he was Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, but thei wold not beleue that, that was true of Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to witte that he was ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before to prepare the waie of Meſſias, &amp; to poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te him forth to the people as it were with his finger. And there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

A minde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with lies catcheth lies ſtraite waie as pitch catcheth fier. For it is agrein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to his nature, and there is a kindred, &amp; conſanguinitee betwene them. It abhorreth truth bicauſe there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of nature, no felowſhip betwene truth, &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes corrupte mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.</p>
            <p>But to beare witnes) The Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt repeteth againe that Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſtes office, &amp; higheſt dignitee was to be a witnes of the light, namely of Goddes ſonne, and to teach the people to ſeke light at his handes, and there to lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr candeles. And he is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced aboue that office, and dignitee, which is as great in dede as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>That was the true light) Here the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt putteth a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene light, &amp; light: Iohan was a light in dede, as the lorde ſaieth, he was a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del burninge &amp; ſhininge. And God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des miniſters ar called the light of the world. But their light is a borowed light, a light giuen vnto them, &amp; not
<pb facs="tcp:26560:45"/> naturally dwellinge in them. The ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del hath no light of it ſelfe, but hath light put in to it from another. This place plainly ſeuereth the lorde Ieſus fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> creatures. For it affirmeth him to be the true light, &amp; denieth them to be the tru light. The lorde Ieſus is light by nature, creatures by borowinge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He giueth light, creatures recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue light. They nede light, bicauſe thei haue none by nature. He is ful of light, &amp; geueth light to them, that nede.</p>
            <p>Seinge tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is ſo great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the lordes light, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes light, the lorde muſt nedes be of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, than a creature. For if a creature colde be tru light, it colde not be ſaide of the ſonne only, that he is the true light. But bicauſe a creature is not the true light, and Goddes ſonne is the true light, therefore Goddes ſonne is anorher thinge than a creature.</p>
            <p>No creature can ſhine, and giue light of it ſelue by nature, Goddes ſonne ſhineth, and giueth light of him ſelfe naturally, (for he is the truelight) ſo he is no creature.</p>

            <p>¶ AS RECEAVED) They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue him, that acknowlege him to be Goddes ſon, and that he became man, &amp; in mannes nature died for the purgation and ſatiſfaction of their ſinnes, breifely to receaue here ſignifieth to beleue, as S.

For they vnderſtande that choiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is giuen vs to be the children of God if we wil, or to refuſe the ſame. But S. Iohan declareth forthwith in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des folowinge, that Goddes children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not made by the wil of the fleſh, but whan they be begotten of God. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des begettinge maketh vs Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ddes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and we ar not left to our choiſe,

And the greke worde that S. Io. vſeth, is not, dynamis, which ſignifieth power, but, exouſia, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifieth dignitee, &amp; auctoritee. Here ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a queſtion if Goddes choſen were by predeſtination his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the beginninge of the world, how agreeth it, that tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ar made his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei beleue. For they were his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren before, beinge his choſen, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate.

            <p>And here alſo I wil giue you an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinge to note. S. Iohan ſaieth that as manie as beleue ar Goddes ſonnes. But none ar now Goddes ſonnes, that were not euer Goddes ſonnes in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

            <p>IN HIS NAME) It is more liuelie, and more ample, and of greater maieſtie, whan it is ſaid to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in his name, than if it had ben ſaide to them that beleue in him. The ſcole men in dede putte a difference betwene credere deum, credere deo, &amp; credere in deum. Credere deum with them, is to beleue that there is a God. Credere deo, is to beleue Goddes ſaiynges. Crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in deum, is to truſt in God, and to lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue him. And therefore S. Auguſtine ſaieth that to beleue in God, is in bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge to loue him, and in louinge, to truſt in him. But the ſcripture obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not this diſtinction. For in the 14. of Exod. we haue that whan the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahelites ſaw the Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Goddes power, thei beleued BA<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>IHOVA, ou be Moſheh abdo. i. in Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>houa, and in Moſes his ſeruant.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, maki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to the purpoſe with as few wordes. For by theſe few wordes, the worde became fleſh, he teacheth, that Goddes natural ſonne, ſo ioigned vnto him ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature, that of two natures one perſon was made, which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge cold not haue ben vttered with other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſo ſhortely, &amp; ſo pithely to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

            <p>For the ſoule is not one perſon, &amp; the bodie another perſon, but they both ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke one perſon namely a man.

<pb facs="tcp:26560:53"/> be two perſons, not one. Therefore the worde ioigninge ſhuld not haue ſo fully expreſſed the matter. For this ioigninge is a ſpecial, &amp; ſingular ioigni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. For Goddes nature is ſo ioigned to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, that one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made of bothe, namely one Chriſt, as of the bodie, and the ſoule one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made. And this is verie neceſſarie for vs to know. For if we imagine the lordes ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a parte, &amp; his Godhead a nature a par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te, with out ſuch a ſingular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction, &amp; vnion, that of both natures one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is made, as the haeretike Neſtorius did, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lorde Ieſus cold not be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te mediator betwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God &amp; vs, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſatiſfaction, &amp; redemption for the ſinnes of the worlde.

And a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demer of al the worlde he can not be, that is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hel, &amp; death, and giue life? Therefore the holie ſcripture teacheth, that the lorde Ieſus was not, theophoros, as Neſtorius dreamed, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god
<pb facs="tcp:26560:53"/> was, whom Gud aſſiſted, &amp; with whom God was preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for God is alſo in vs, but in him the godhead was ſo knitte, &amp; v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod, as thoſe twaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de one perſon. And ſo it is wel &amp; truly ſaide that God purchaſed his, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on with his blood, and that the lorde of glorie, that is to ſaie, God was crucified, not that he ſuffred in his diuine nature, but bycauſe thoſe two natures ioigned vnſpeakably together make one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therefore that the one nature did, and ſuffred, is attributed to thother, &amp; ſome times to bothe together, that pertai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eth to one only. Which colde not be, if thei were two ſondrie perſons. As if the ſoule were a perſon alone by it ſelfe, &amp; the bodie a perſon alone by it ſelfe, the ſoule ſhuld not ſo be ſaide to do, or ſuffre that the bodie did, ot ſuffred, nor the bodie, that the ſoule did de or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, nor the hole man, that one parte only did or ſuffred, which thinges yet we now admitte, bicauſe of the vnitee of the perſon. We muſt know than this vnitee of perſon in the lorde Ieſus,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:54"/> God &amp; man which the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly teacheth in theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>But where he ſaieth, the worde beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fleſh, he meaneth that the worde abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de ſtil though it became fleſh, that the worde I ſaie was not chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged turned, &amp; altered from his awn nature in to fleſh.</p>
            <p>For ſome auoidinge Neſtorius haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, who made two perſons in Chriſt, fled the ſmoke, &amp; ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the fier. For ether thei turned the diuine nature in to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nature, or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature in to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, or ſo confuſed, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled the two natures together that nether nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained perfectly, as whan wine &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ar me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled to gether there remaineth nether perfectte wine nor perfectte wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In our time alſo ſome Anabaptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue taught, that the diuine nature was turned in to fleſh for a time, &amp; beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me felcable, and that now the lordes fleſh is turned in to his diuine nature againe, and is no more fleſh. Which dreame is to to ſonde. For it implieth a plaine impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitee. For it is as impoſſible for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des nature to be altered, &amp; chaunged, as it is impoſſible for it to ceaſe to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:26560:54"/> nature. For what ſo euer maie be altered, and chaunged, hath an imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, &amp; is ſubiecte to paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But Goddes nature hath no imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor is ſubiecte to paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for that were not to be God, ſo his nature ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. We muſt therefore ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, &amp; beleue the ioigninge to gether, &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of two natures in Chriſt, that we me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not together, nor turne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in to the other, but that eche remaine ſtil in his awne propre nature. The Godhead is not the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod, nor the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, the Godhead. The Godhead is a nature by it ſelfe, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hod a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by it ſelfe, &amp; of thoſe two natures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Chriſt conſiſteth. This vnitinge to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether of two natures, Cyrille laboureth to teach weake vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinges by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, though ſimilitudes in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe haue ſome imperfection. Theſe be his wordes: Eſaie the prophete ſaieth, one of the Seraphins was ſent vnto me, &amp; he had a coale in his hande, which he toke from the altar, &amp; he ſaide beholde I haue touched thy lippes with this, &amp; it ſhal purge thine iniquitee. We ſaye
<pb facs="tcp:26560:55"/> that the fiere coale giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th vnto vs a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and image of the worde made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which if it ſhal touch our lippes, that is to ſaie, if thorough faith we ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it, it maketh vs pure from al ſinne. But as it were in an image we maie beholde in the coale God the worde vnited to mannes nature, &amp; yet that he hath not caſt awai, that he was before, but hath rather tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformed the nature which he receaued, to his glorie &amp; operation.</p>
            <p>For as fier fixed in the woodde, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge in to it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the wood, &amp; though the wood ceaſe not to be wood ſtil, yet the fier ſendeth his force in to it, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueieth it ſelfe in to it, and is now thought to be one with it, ſo vndreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of Chriſt. For God beinge incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſibly vnited to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature, hath in that kepte the ſame, that he was, &amp; he remaineth ſtille that he was, but yet beinge once vnited, he is compted as it were one with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature, makinge that, that pertained to it his awne, &amp; giuinge it the operation of his nature. Hitherto Cyrille. He vſeth alſo in this
<pb facs="tcp:26560:55"/> matter the ſimilitude of mannes bodie and ſoule ioign'd together, which in dede expreſſeth it of al other moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely. For the ſoule is not turned in to the bodie, nor the bodie in to the ſoule, but ech retaineth his propre nature, &amp; maketh one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>AND the word) In that he ſaieh the worde became fleſh, &amp; not man, he ſheweth how far Goddes ſonne hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled and abaſed him ſelfe. For the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re calleth man fleſh, whan it wil ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the pouertie, vilenes, and miſerie of man. As whan it is ſaide al fleſh is graſſe, and he remembred, that they were but fleſh, &amp; my ſpirite ſhal not euer ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in man, for he is fleſh. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Euangeliſt ſaieth, the worde became fleſh, we maie not imagine, that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſonne ioigned to his diuine nature fleſh only, and not mannes ſoule as Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pollinaris thought in his trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that fleſh, and the Godhead made one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Chriſt without mannes ſoule.</p>
            <p>For he imagined that the diuinitee was in ſtede of a ſoule.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:56"/>
            <p>But ſo it ſhuld folow, that the lorde Ieſus was not a verie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For fleſh is not a man. For the ſoule is the formal parte of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely that whereby a man is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with out which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be. And that the lord had a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his diuinitee, he him ſelfe teſtifieth, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaieth, my ſoule is heauie vnto the death. Nether ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apollinaris aide him ſelfe with this place. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcripture calleth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleſh, it meaneth not that thei ar without ſoules. For tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei were no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt know alſo from whens Goddes ſonne became fleſh. For we maie not thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke that he brought his fleſh from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or made it in the aire. For the holie ſcripture teacheth, that he ſhul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of the ſede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Dauid, &amp; ſhuld be the fruite of his loines. For ſuch plaine wordes it vſeth to aſſure vs of the truth of ſo neceſſarie a matter, &amp; vtterly to ſtoppe the mouthes of dotin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in the writers of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is moſt plainly ſette forth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs, that he receaued fleſh out of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the virgin Marie. For. S.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:56"/> Mattheu hath theſe wordes (to gar en aute gennethen) that which is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in hir, &amp;. S. Paule (genomenon ek<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynaicos) made of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in S. Luke (ho karpos) the frute of thy wombe. The frute of a tree is of the ſame ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the tree is of. That which only paſſeth thorough a thinge, is not the frute of that thinge. For wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not the frute of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducte pipe, nor ale the frute of the ſpickette, or of the kinderkinne. Againſt this moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt truth wherein the pith of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth, the franctike Anabaptiſtes bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge two pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipal reaſons, I wot not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, or more vngodly. For firſt thei ſaie that if the lorde recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued our fleſh, he receaued vncleane fleſh. But iudge you whether al the ſcriptures be they neuer ſo plaine muſt giue place to this their ſimple imagination, or whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther their ſimple imagination ſhuld giue place to ſo manie plaine ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>But firſt I aſke them whether God cold not make cleane our vncleane fleſh, or wold not. If thei ſaie he colde nor, they limitte his power ouer much. If thei ſaie
<pb facs="tcp:26560:57"/> he wolde not, we wil hiſſe them out.</p>
            <p>For if God of his goodnes wolde ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke his ſonne to die for vs, he wolde of his goodnes make his fleſh cleane for vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly laſke them why God wold haue his ſonne to be borne of a virgine, &amp; not to be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after the commune courſe of the worlde. Doeth not that teache vs that he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make his ſonnes fleſh pure &amp; holie? Yea doeth not the angel ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in Luke, whan he ſaieth, the holie goſt ſhal comme vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the, &amp; the power of the higheſt ſhal ouerſſhadow the, for which cauſe the holie thinge to gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomeno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, ſhalbe called Goddes ſonne. But this their reaſon hath no weight, bicauſe it is o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly forged in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes braine. Thother is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſcripture. For S. Paule to the Cor. writeth thus: The firſt man was of the erth, erthlie. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In which place S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les purpoſe is not to ſpeake of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of our bodies, or of the ſubſtance of the lordes bodie, but of the qualities, as the wordes folowinge declare, hoios, of
<pb facs="tcp:26560:57"/> what qualitee the erthlie was, of that qualitie ar the erthlie, &amp; of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie is, of that qualitee ar the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie. This tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the ſenſe. The firſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was of the erth, erthlie, that is ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te to ſinne &amp; corrupte affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which bringe death. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie, that is ful of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie qualities, which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the power of Goddes ſpirite draw with them life, &amp; immortalitte. As we bare the image of the erthlie, that is we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſinful, and therefore compaſſed with death, ſo ſhal we beare the image of the heauenlie, that is our ſpirites ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to tru holines, &amp; our bodies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitee. Wherefore wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaieth the ſeconde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the lorde from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he meaneth not that he brought his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from heauen, but that he is heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he expouneth himſelfe, that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie qualities.</p>
            <p>Now to procede in our former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it ſhalbe good to ſeke out the cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes why Goddes ſonne became fleſh, or as Sainct Paule ſpeaketh why God was manifeſted in fleſh.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:58"/>
            <p>And no man can ſhew vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly than S. Paule hath don to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bru. For there he teacheth vs, that the cheife, and principal cauſe was, that by death he might deſtroie him that had deathes power, that is Satan. For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had power <abbr>ov</abbr> vs, to puniſh vs with death, bicauſe we were ſinners. And ſinne cold not be purged but in the fleſh of Goddes ſonne. If he had remained God only, purgation, and ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for ſinne cold not haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made by him.</p>
            <p>For the Godhead cold not ſuffre, nor ſhew obedience. But ſith thorough diſobedience ſinne came in to the world, it muſt be putte awaye thorough obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which required mannes nature.</p>
            <p>Howbeit if he had ben man only, he could not haue ouercomme death, nether ſhuld his ſatiſfaction haue ben ſufficient for the ſinnes of al the world, as we tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before, yea ſcarcely for the ſinnes of one man. For the maieſtie of God that is offended thorough ſinne, is infinite.</p>
            <p>And therefore he muſt be no leſſe, that ſhal make ſatiſfaction to that maieſtie.</p>
            <p>It was than of neceſſitee that God ſhuld
<pb facs="tcp:26560:58"/> becomme ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe was that he might be made like to his brethern, ſinne only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte. For as S. Paule writeth it was ſemelie for him, for whom, &amp; by whom al thinges ar, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wold bringe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to glorie, to make the high capitaine of their ſaluation perfecte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſuffringes. For he that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, &amp; thei that be ſanctifieed ar al of one. For which cauſe he is not aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amed to cal them brethern, ſaiynge, I wil ſhew forth thy name to my brethern and againe I wil truſt in him, and agai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, lo I &amp; the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. Seinge than that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were partakers of fleſh, &amp; blood, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe became partaker of the ſame &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A thirde cauſe S. Paule reherſeth, &amp; that is that he might be merciful, &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the miſerie of his people, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge felt te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations him ſelfe, that is to ſaie, that we might be the better perſuaded, and certified that he wold pitie vs, knowin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that he had experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and felinge of our miſeries &amp; griefes in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>For we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not thincke that anie ſhuld pi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:26560:59"/> vs ſo wel, as he that feleth, or hath felt the ſame grife &amp; ſmarte that we do.</p>
            <p>To returne to S. Io. in thes his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the worde became fleſh, we haue a ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gular conſolation, in that I ſaie Goddes ſonne hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleſh of our fleſh, &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of our bones. For ſo haue we a nigh affinitee, &amp; familiaritee with God. And ſo that, that was ours, is made God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and that, that was Goddes, is made ours. And we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not doubte but that he wil do al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges for vs, who beinge God wold familiarly be ioigned to vs in our nature. In te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, &amp; wraſtlinges of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, let vs flie hereunto, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre this great goodnes, &amp; excedinge loue, &amp; fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlines, &amp; we ſhal be relieued &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the baleful pit of deſpeare,</p>
            <p>AND dwelt) The greke worde eſcenoſen, is aſmuch to ſaie, as he made his tabernacle. Whereby the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt ſignifieth, that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge them, as a verie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not him ſelfe the twincklinge of an eye, &amp; ſo vaniſhed awaie, but had his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ode, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> longe time, whereby thei might haue ſure, &amp; certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb facs="tcp:26560:59"/> experience of his godlie behauior, of his ſingular vertues, and of his wondre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worckes. Some thincke that by this worde is ſignified, that the lorde Ieſus had no certaine dwellinge place in this world, but was faine to flitte often, and remoue. For ſo do thei that dwel in tentes, &amp; tabernacles.</p>
            <p>In vs) Chryſoſtome taketh (in vs) for in our fleſh, and vnderſtandeth, that the humanitee of Chriſt was a taberna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle to the diuinitee, &amp; ſo frameth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt the haeretikes, that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the worde to be turned in to fleſh.</p>
            <p>The word dwelt in fleſh, ergo the worde was not turned in to fleſh, and made fleſh only. For nothinge dwelleth in it ſelfe. It is alſo true that it is taken for amonge, in manie places of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. One ſhal ſuffice for this purpoſe Act. 4. There was not one nedie, en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>autois, in them, that is to ſaie amonge them. The worde, eſcenoſen, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de his tente or tabernacle, fauoreth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me what Chryſoſtomes vnderſtandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:60"/>
            <p>AND we haue ſeen) Now the E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth his awne experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, &amp; the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thother Apoſtles, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples, which with their awne eyes ſaw ſuch actes of the lorde Ieſus, as proued hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Goddes only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne. The Latines haue a prouerbe, that one eyed witnes is worth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eared. Of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which we haue ſeen with our awne eyes we maye be faithful witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Thapoſtles bicauſe thei ſaw the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, which thei witneſſed to the worlde ar called in the holie ſcripture, with a meruailous elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worde, autop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai, ſelfe ſeers, &amp;, epoptai, inſeers, or onbe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>holders.</p>
            <p>WE haue ſeen) Where the Grekes haue ſondrie wordes, that ſignifie to ſee, the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt vſeth a ſpecial one, ethea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſametha, which ſignifieth to beholde a thinge dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; leaſurely. We maie ſee thinges glaunſingly, which ſight is not ſo perfecte, &amp; certaine, as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>holde a thinge ſtedfaſtly, &amp; leaſurely.</p>
            <p>The Grekes haue propre wordes for both kindes of ſeinge. The thinges that thapoſtles ſaw, thei ſo ſaw, as they cold
<pb facs="tcp:26560:60"/> not be deceaued, &amp; therefore they ar called, peplerophoremena, fully aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>His glorie) The diuinitee of the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Ieſus ſhined out of his wordes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des at al times, &amp; in al places. His uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, &amp; innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life, his miracles, his re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurrection, his aſcenſion, &amp; ſendinge of the holie goſt, did ſpeake, &amp; as it were, crie out that he was Goddes ſonne. He gaue them alſo a taſt of his diuinitee, &amp; heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lye maieſtie, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riouſly tranſfigured before them in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But how do miracles proue the diuinitee of Chriſt, ſeinge that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue don the like, as Elias and Elizeus in the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and thapoſtles in the new. You ſhal vndreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that the lorde Ieſus did miracles by his awne power, which the ſcripture obſerueth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth plai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a boro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed power. Of the lorde worcki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles the ſcripture ſaieth, I ſaie vnto the ariſe, I charge the go out. Of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Ieſus make the hole, in the name of the lorde Ieſus ariſe, &amp; walke. Man receaueth power to worcke miracles,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:61"/> God giueth power. But the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re witneſſeth that the lorde Ieſus giueth alſo power to worcke miracles, &amp; that in his awne name. Whereby we eaſely ſee the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lordes worckinge &amp; of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes worckinge of miracles.</p>
            <p>The glorie as of) We behelde ſuch glorie, &amp; magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as beſemeth god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne, &amp; agreeth only to him. The worde, as, ſome times ſignifieth not the thinge to be in dede, but a likenes of it, as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſaie, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth holily, as a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pocrite. Some times it noteth the truth of a matter &amp; a thinge truly to be don. Walke as the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of light ſaieth Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le.

            <p>To our purpoſe, Kinges, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue their glorie, and their maieſtie ſemelie for their ſtate, the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had glorie ſemelie for Goddes ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</p>
            <p>¶ THE ONLY BEGOTTEN)</p>
            <p>This word auanceth the Lorde Ieſus aboue al creatures, and teacheth him to be Goddes natural ſon. We ar alſo called Goddes ſonnes, but that is by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option, by fauor, by grace, &amp; not by na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural generation. By natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration God hath one only ſonne, who of his goodnes, &amp; mercie hath made vs partakers of that, that he is by nature.</p>
            <p>This word, only begotten, ought wel to be weighed. For it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Lorde Ieſus to be of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſubſtance, that the father is of, and
<pb facs="tcp:26560:62"/> and therefore verie God, and aequal to the father. For theſe thinges hange to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, &amp; folow one another. For our Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt teacheth in the .5. chap. that whan the lorde Ieſus ſaied, God was his father, he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, patera idion, his awne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is his natural father, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed him ſelfe aequal to God.</p>
            <p>For it foloweth in dede, that if God be his awne father, that is to ſaie, his father by natural generation, he muſt nedes be aequal to God his father, For in the Godhead there is nothinge greater, or ſmaller. He that is of Goddes ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce muſt nedes be God. And he that is God muſt nedes be infinite, aboue al me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſure, &amp; greatnes. So to be Goddes, o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne, &amp; God to be his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne father, bothe which wordes this Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge braine againſt his tru, &amp; natural god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Yet the Arrians lille out theyr blaſphemous tounges ſtil, &amp; francticly allege the ſcriptures for them. For firſt thei iangle that it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the father is greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I.

<pb facs="tcp:26560:62"/> firſt I ſaye that one place of this goſpel is not to be expouned agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the hole purpoſe of the boke, which is to teach that the lorde Ieſus is Goddes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſonne, &amp; aequal to God. And ſith the Euangeliſt hath this worde aequal plainly and expreſſely, thei ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues mad that wold make him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt himſelfe. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly I ſaie that in that place the lorde Ieſus compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not his ſubſtance, with the fathers ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but compareth his preſent hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate, with the glorious ſtate, that he ſhulde haue after his aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore al the godlie old fathers welnigh haue taught thoſe wordes to be ſpoken of his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature, which ſhuld be forth with aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to immortal, &amp; incorrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tible glorie, by the power of the father.</p>
            <p>Some greke writers in dede admitte, that the father is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonne, not bicauſe he hath greater power, or that there is anie differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce, &amp; eſſence, but in that he is the father, and begetteth the ſonne, and is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſonne, therefore he maie be ſaide greater. The meaninge alſo of
<pb facs="tcp:26560:63"/> thoſe wordes, the father is greater than I, maie be this. The ende why I trauaile with you is not that you ſhuld ſtaie in me, and loke no farther, but to bringe you to the father, as to the laſt marcke, that with me you maie ſee him, as he is. Whoſe glorie is more dere to me tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is myn awne glorie, &amp; therefore I ſeke it more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myne awne, &amp; I thincke that I haue not accompliſhed myne office vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>til I haue brought you to him. But our Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſith they be ouer the ſhoues, ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not blindly to preſſe forwarde, &amp; to goe ouer the bootes to. For thei ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to this place writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Cor. chap. 15. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thinges ſhalbe made ſubiecte to him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal the ſonne alſo him ſelfe be aſſubiected to him, who hath aſſubiected al thinges to him. But what if we au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that, that alſo is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touchinge his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature? For the ſame autor S.

Naie ſaie they, for than he ſhuld not haue ſaide ſhalbe aſſubiected, for that nature is al readie ſubiecte.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:63"/>
            <p>Wil they grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than that the lorde Ieſus hath a nature, that is not now ſubiecte to God, but ſhalbe hereafter? If they wil grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil I ſaie, that what ſo euer is not now ſubiecte to God in the lorde Ieſus, ſhal <abbr>nev</abbr> be ſubiecte to God.</p>
            <p>For that, that is once aequal to God, ſhal euer be aequal to God. How than is it ſaide that his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature ſhalbe aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſubiected, if it be al readie aſſubiected?

            <p>For fuller vndreſtandinge of that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Sainct Paule, ye ſhal conſidre that al power is giuen to Chriſt, in that he is clothed with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature.

            <p>God in dede is our gouernor, but it is in the face of Chriſtes ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes nature.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt ſhal ſurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre the kingdom, that was giuen vnto him, that we maie cleaue perfectly to God. Howbeit he ſhal not by that meanes vtterly giue vp his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where of as the ſcripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth there is no ende, but he ſhal as it were conueie it from his manhod to his godhead.

            <p>Ioanne witneſſeth) Io. was vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly by the confeſſion of al men, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his aduerſaries a man of rare vprightnes of life, of excedinge great grauitee, and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantie, &amp; ſo for from flatterie, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſinge, that nether honor, and courtely pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t intertaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor the face of a cruel tyraunt, nor moſt painful empriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor the preſence of horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death cold moue him to forbeare to ſpeake the truth at al times.

            <p>And cried) This worde aunciant writters do wel note. And partly they teach that thereby an alluſion is made, and a regarde had to the wordes of the prophete Eſaie, the voice of one criyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in the wildernes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly thei ſaie, that thereby is ſett forth the plaine, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For he vttered not the matter with a ſoft, faint, tremblinge, waueringe, darcke and doubteful voice, that few might heare it, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it, but he cried with an aſſured min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, with great confidence and boldnes, with an erneſt Zeale, deſiringe that his voice might clearely ſounde to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of al men. Such ſhuld al the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of goddes truth be, no whiſperers, no dreaners, no faint &amp; darcke ſpeakers, but criers.

In this point Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſt excelleth al other pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes, that were before him.

            <p>But touchinge the humanitee of the lord Ieſus, he was not before Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but after him.

Howbeit touchinge his diuine nature, it is truly ſaid, that the lord Ieſus was before Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not in the beginninge with God, Goddes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, Goddes brightnes, Goddes ſonne, &amp; verie God. Touchinge this nature the lorde him ſelfe ſaieth, before Abraham was, I am.</p>
            <p>Was before me) The old latine tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the greke had, factus eſt, was made before me, which cauſed much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous talke amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vaine tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinge of wittes, how the lord cold be ſaid to be made before Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>The ambiguitee, &amp; doubtful ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word deceaued both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, &amp; them.

            <p>Was before) In matters of religion we haue great regarde what me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before vs haue thought.

            <p>For he was my firſt) The worde, for, rendreth a cauſe why a thinge is don.

<pb facs="tcp:26560:69"/> bodily, that is to ſaie ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially, not in image, not in ſhadow, but in bodie in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in dede. We lerne tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Io.

And more ouer that we nede not feare left we ſhal want anie ſpiritual thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, if we reſorte to him, ſeinge that he hath the fulnes of the ſpirite. Laſtly that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ſo euer thei be, ar voide of grace, and godlines by nature, ſith al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue out of the fulnes of Goddes ſonne.</p>
            <p>We al, ſaieth Io. Bap. nombri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge him ſelfe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the reſt. And if Io.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge maie be leſt to anie, where of to boſt. For if thei haue receaued out of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of another, why ſhuld they boſt as though thei had not borowed al of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but had poſſeſſed ſome what of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues.
<pb facs="tcp:26560:70"/> Wherefore theſe wordes of Io.

And here we maie not paſſe ouer, that this place alſo proueth the Lord Ieſus to be verie god. For who is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of al know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege, goodnes, holines &amp; ſpiritual graces in al ages, &amp; in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but God only?</p>
            <p>But as we muſt know hereby that he is God, ſo we muſt know that he poſſeſſeth not theſe thinges to this ende, that he maie haue no maner of want, but to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them forth to the vſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he kepeth not his treaſures to him ſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiouſly, or niggeſhly, but ioieth to diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribute them, and to ſende them abrode. Nether is he a merchaunt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le of them, but giueth them frely as we ar taught in Eſaie: O al ye that thirſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To buyie for no moneie is a verie eaſie buyinge, yea it is no buyinge, but a free receauinge. Sith tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lorde Ieſus poſſeſſeth the ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of al ſpititual riches, &amp; poſſeſſeth the

For he hath alſo manie good thinges, which he giueth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the reprobate as beautie, &amp; ſtrenghth of bodie, eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; knowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of liberal ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, wordlie riches &amp;c. But he hath certaine ſpecial iuels, which he giueth only to his choſen, namely tru faith,, true righteouſnes, &amp; holines, true ioifulnes, patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, true peace, &amp; quietnes of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>Grace for grace) This ſentence is ſondrie wiſe expouned. I wil firſt ſhew you S. Auguſtines minde. Theſe be his wordes vpon this place. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brethern al we haue receaued out of his fulnes, out of the fulnes of his mercie haue we receaued, what? Remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, that
<pb facs="tcp:26560:71"/> we might be iuſtified by faith. And what more ouer? Grace for grace, that is to wit, for this grace whereby we liue of faith we ſhal receaue another grace, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely euerlaſtinge life. But what els is it ſaue grace? For if I ſhal ſaie, that this is due to me, I aſſigne ſome what to my ſelfe, as to whom it is due. But God crouneth the giftes of his mercie in vs. Thus ye ſee S. Auguſtines meaninge, to wit, that al Goddes good giftes, and in the ende euerlaſtinge life, is not a recom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of our merites, but commeth of the free liberalitee of God, bicauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him ſo to rewarde his former graces, &amp; to croune his awne giftes in vs. And ſo he calleth faith whereby we ar iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one grace, &amp; euerlaſtinge life another grace, verie truly &amp; godly, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the commune idols ſouldiars.</p>
            <p>Other expouninge grace for grace, grace vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace, reach that out of this ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of his ſonne god gaue to our fathers vndre the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſpirite of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, whereby as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vndre a ſcolemaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thei were kepte in, &amp; reſtrained, that thei ſhuld not ſtraie abrode after fleſhlie
<pb facs="tcp:26560:71"/> luſtes, but be led forth, &amp; framed to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me godlines. And in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he giueth the ſpirite of fredo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby with more fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke, &amp; free hertes, &amp; with more ioiful courage by the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirite, we do the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, that pleaſe god. Not that our fathers were al together voide of this free ſpirite, but bicauſe of their childlie age thei were more kepte vndre by feare, &amp; the ſpirite was not ſo richely, &amp; largely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to vs, I meane vniuerſally touchinge goddes or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinarie diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſation. For to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial perſons the ſpirite was as largely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and more largely tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is now.</p>
            <p>The expoſition of other is, that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; fauoreth vs bicauſe of the loue, &amp; fauor, that he beareth to his ſonne, as S. Paule writeth, that he hath made vs ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceptable in the biloued. For by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re we ar the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wrath, &amp; the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, &amp; fauor that we finde i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goddes ſight, is for that, that of his awne goodnes he hath made vs, the membres of his moſt derely biloued ſonne, &amp; ſo loueth vs, as a parte of his ſonnes bodie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:72"/>
            <p>Other thincke that the meaninge of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe wordes is, that God powreth al his graces in to the lord Ieſus, &amp; by him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueieth the ſame vnto vs, as by a conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te pipe. I leaue to your choiſe which of theſe expoſtions you wil folow.</p>
            <p>The law) The nature of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munely ether to giue to litle, or to much reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Goddes miniſters. And to deſpice them while thei liue, and whan thei be ded, to make them more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes. In the time of the lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erth, the Iues had Moſes in ſuch reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and eſtimation, that thei made him verie litle leſſe than a God. In Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis perſon thei gloried, Moſeis perſon thei boſted, and extolled aboue the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Thei had this alſo that thei ſo puſt vp them ſelues in their knowlege of Goddes wil, and in their holie, &amp; perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te worckes wrought accordinge to the rule of the law, as that thei excelled al other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; were halfe goddes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erth and more mete to be placed in paradiſe amonge the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie ſpirites, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in this vale of miſerie amonge ſinful men. Wherefore Io. Baptiſt to plante
<pb facs="tcp:26560:72"/> Chriſt Ieſus in the hertes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſent to be a teacher, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to aduance his glorie, laboureth to pulle thoſe two great hindrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces out of their hertes, namely their prepoſterous gloryinge in the perſone of Goddes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and their vaine confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their awne holines, and righteouſnes. And firſt he ſetteth vp the lord Ieſus far aboue Moſes, makinge a compariſon betwene the office of Moſes, and the lordes office. For he aſſigneth to Moſes, that he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and gaue the law to the people he aſſigneth to the lord Ieſus, that he hath brought grace, &amp; truth. Now there is a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge greate differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe two offices. For thone is the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tration of death, and condemnation, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of life, &amp; iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The law in de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de preſcribeth vnto vs true holines, &amp; certainly ſheweth vs what we ought to do, and to leaue vndon in euerie pointe, but while thereby ether it repreſſeth, &amp; reſtraineth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes raginge luſtes, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth al men, &amp; proueth that thei do not the thinges thei ought to do, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchue the thinges, thei ought to eſchue,
<pb facs="tcp:26560:73"/> as S. Paule lernedly and truly writeth, it encreaſeth ſinne, worcketh wrath, killeth and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth vs. It encreaſeth ſinne, bicauſe the more our luſtes ar reſtrained, the more ragingly thei burſt out. It worcketh wrath, bicauſe that whan our luſtes ar bridled, we ar angrie with God for puttinge that ſnaffel in to our mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, &amp; ſo to our other vices we adde diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſtubburnnes, &amp; murmuringe againſt God. It killeth and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth bicauſe it pronounceth al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accurſed, that kepe not the thinges preſcribed, &amp; taught in it, to the vttermoſt title, where as we perfirme not one iote perfetly, as we ſhuld. But here we muſt know that the law of hir ſelfe, &amp; of hir awne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, hath not theſe effectes, but by accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is by the meanes of our vicious, nawghtie corrupte nature. For the law is good, holie, &amp; iuſt, &amp; worcketh not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of hir awne nature, but bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe our ſinful nature can abide no good thinge, therefore of neceſſitee it muſt be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by that, that is good, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame is laied vnto it. The propre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb facs="tcp:26560:73"/> is not in the ſumme beames, that they make a carion to ſtincke the more, but in the nature of the carion. For thei ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne upon other bodies without ſuch effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. If our nature were good, the law ſhuld be moſt liuelie, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Now bicauſe it is corrupte, &amp; poi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoned, the law worcketh not the thinges that it wold, and ſhuld, but the thinges that ſuch a nature wil only ſuffre to be wrought.</p>
            <p>Grace and truth) We haue now the of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice of Moſes, letre vs on thother ſide co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidre the office of the lord Ieſus. But firſt lett vs vndreſtande the wordes. By gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce ſome vndreſtande that, that maketh vs amiable, and acceptable, and getteth vs fauor before God &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By truth thei vndreſtande true, ſincere perfecte, ſounde, and ſure righteouſnes. Other by grace in this place vndreſtande forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes of ſinnes, and by truth the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of al the figures, and ſhadowes of Moſeis law. In which ſo euer ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation you ſhal take the wordes, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſhalbe good, and godlie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:74"/>
            <p>For the lorde Ieſus maketh vs amiable and acceptable in Goddes ſight, apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge vs with his awne ſwete ſmellinge garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that is with his awne holines, and he renueth our mindes vnto true, ſound, and faſt abidinge righteouſnes, he alſo hath optained for vs remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſinnes, &amp; hath perfirmed al that was ſhadowed in Moſeis law. For he hath waſhed, ſanctified, and purged vs with his awne blood. He hath ſuffred death in our ſtede, and offred him ſelfe a ſlaine ſacrifice vpon the croſſe to be a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſatiſfaction for the ſinnes of al God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des choſen, &amp; to appeaſe for euer God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des wrath kinled againſt ſinne. And here we ar clearely taught that the law cold not bringe theſe thinges to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore al thei that haue aſſigned righteouſnes and acceptation in Goddes ſight to the dedes of the law, or haue ſought anie holines, anie forgiuenes of ſinnes, anie ſparcke of grace &amp; life other waies, than by the lord Ieſus only, &amp; alo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, haue miſerably begiled them ſelues to their perpetual confuſion, and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let vs my brethern be no more
<pb facs="tcp:26560:74"/> deluded, but reſorte to the true fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine of al heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie graces, &amp; draw from thens thorough faith ſincere holines, and true righteouſnes, and what ſo euer maie ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke vs amiable, and acceptable in Goddes ſight, that we maie glorie in no maner of thinge, ſaue in the lord Ieſus alone, our only ſanctifier, iuſtifier, ſaueor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptor, and what ſo euer our nede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that he ſhulde be vnto vs. For what was impoſſible for the law to do, in that it was weake thorow the fleſh, God hath perfirmed hauinge ſent his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the likenes of ſinful fleſh, &amp; by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that is to ſaie, by a ſacrifice for ſinne hath condemned ſinne in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>This ſonne of God is made vnto vs wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption. This ſonne of God hath raunſomed vs from the curſe of the law. This ſonne of god is the ende of the law, to iuſtifie al that beleue. This ſonne of God had giuen vs the ſpirite of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſpirite of Goddes childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of fredom, the ſpirite of alacritee, &amp; good courage. Theſe thinges Io. Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſte teacheth, and ſo quaileth the Iueis
<pb facs="tcp:26560:75"/> vaine gloriynge in Moſes, &amp; their vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne gloriynge in their awne holines, and righteouſnes, to the high aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him, to whom al glorie is due, euen Ieſus Chriſt our only lorde &amp; ſaueor.</p>
            <p>No man hath ſeen God &amp;c.) Now to confirme the thinge that he had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied touchinge Moſes, namely that he muſt ſitte far beneth the lorde Ieſus, in this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he giueth vs to vndreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that the verie knowlege of Goddes wil, &amp; of the law, that Moſes had, he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it from Goddes ſonne. For nether Moſes, nor anie other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cold attaine to anie certaine knowlege of Goddes wil, or ſhal euer attaine hereafter, but by the reuelation of him, that is in Goddes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. So Moſes whoſe paſſinge great knowlege they boſted ſo much, was but the lord Ieſus his ſcolar, and therefore of dutie muſt giue place to his maſter.</p>
            <p>The Iues Indede had euer in their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, that Moſes had ſeen God, and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken with him mouth to mouth, ſo that god had no ſecrete, that he had not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him. But the truth is that
<pb facs="tcp:26560:75"/> no mortal man can attaine to a ful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Goddes infinite maieſtie, and ſee his face as it is. For whan Moſes de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſired to ſee Goddes glorie and maieſtie, aunſwer was made vnto him, thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt not ſee my face, for man ſhal not ſee me, and liue. Wherefore whan the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture ſayeth, that Iacob ſaw God face to face, and that Moſes talked with him mouth to mouth, the meaninge is, that God opened him ſelfe more plainly, &amp; talked with them more familiarly than with other men. How beyt they ſaw not his awne verie face, that is thei attayned not to a ful knowlege of the diuinitee. For as Tertullian lernedly writeth mannes minde can not comprehende the thinges, that be in God. For God is greater than mannes minde, nether can it be thought how great he is.</p>
            <p>For if God cold be comprehended by thought than he ſhuld be leſſe than mannes minde, whereby he might be conceaued.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26560:76"/>
            <p>He is greater alſo than al ſpeech, nether can he be vttered with wordes. For if he cold be vttered with wordes; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhuld be leſſe then mannes ſpeech, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby he might be compaſſed. But what ſo euer ſhalbe thought of him, ſhalbe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he, &amp; what <abbr>ſoev</abbr> ſhalbe ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhalbe leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, that is aboute him. For if thou ſhalt calle hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light, thou ſhalt name a creature of his, &amp; not expreſſe hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If thou ſhalt calle hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <abbr>vtue</abbr>, thou ſhalt ſpeake of his power, and not vtter him. If thou ſhalt calle him maieſtie, that ſhalt deſcribe his honor, and not himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Breifely what ſo euer thou ſhalt ſaie of him, thou ſhalt rather declare a thinge of his, than him ſelfe. For what canſt thou worthely ſpeake, or thincke of him, who is greater than al wordes, &amp; al vndreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, ſainge that one waie we maie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
